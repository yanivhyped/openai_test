0,"Treat others how you would like to be treated: the golden rule. Regardless of your religious beliefs or affiliations, it stands to reason that this is a good principle to follow in order to build a moral foundation for one's actions. This ""golden rule"" or sometimes ""ethic of reciprocity"" appears universally throughout civilizations and cultures, dating back as far as 2000 BCE in Ancient Egypt. Despite its ubiquity in philosophy and religion, small business owners somehow seemed to have missed the memo, often expecting considerations from their workers that they themselves would never give to anyone. This brings us to a common problem regarding the 'trust fall' that is notice periods (and the act of giving notice in general) in the United States. With most of the US being employment at will, your employer could send you packing 20 seconds from now for whatever reason they desired, such as manifesting the failure of their business. So, when you go to give them your two-week notice, you might expect them to do the same in return, but they could take that notice and terminate your employment on the spot.With this in mind, when an employer has proven that, when push comes to shove, they themself won't follow a notice period, you shouldn't either when leaving that business. (However, if an employer has shown you nothing but respect, it would be wise to treat them with the same.)After watching two of their coworkers be let go without notice or warning, this worker knew that they were going to be saddled with the whole team's work and quickly made plans to make moves and get out of the toxic bakery where they worked. You might say, after all is bread and done, that the employer has found themselves in a shit show of their own baking. They'll knead to get on their hiring game to save themselves from disaster.

1,"Let's be honest, men have a tendency to put all the responsibility on the woman. Be it deciding what we'll eat for dinner or packing for a weekend trip away. Not like we have full-time jobs or anything. Must be nice to turn off your brain, not have to think about anything, and just be. But the funny thing is, not only do they put all this pressure on us, but they'll also blame us when things go wrong. 'You forgot to pack my favorite pair of shorts?', 'You forgot to buy my favorite snack'? The audacity! Welp, today we're bringing you a story of exactly just that: a neglectful husband that refuses to take responsibility and accountability for his own actions. Instead, he forces his wife to be the adult while he enjoys his carefree life. Welp, it looks like she finally taught him a well-deserved lesson.

2,"Some housing communities have something called a homeowner association, and oftentimes, its purpose is to act as a little parasite, bugging people to no end with ridiculous notions such as 'Making sure your lawn is green enough' — in February, no less. This man was fined for exactly that, as well as for the fact that his trash cans were 1 foot away from where they were 'supposed to be', and he found it utterly ludicrous. He refused to accept this reality, so he came up with a plan. What ensued is a mix of malicious compliance and petty revenge. He took it upon himself to join the board with the sole purpose of revolutionalizing it to the point where people would not receive fines for things such as their flowers not fitting the neighborhood's aesthetic (Yeah… that is apparently a thing in some places. Just… wow). He succeeded far beyond his expectations and gives a detailed account of what happened below. Turns out the VP was quite the hypocrite, which makes this all the more infuriating.

3,"Have you ever wondered what your cats do when you're asleep or when you're not home? We have, all the time. Every single time we leave the house for any extended time, we think about what our cats spend the whole day doing. Of course, cats go out of their way to cause chaos even when we are home, but we always assume that they really take the opportunity to do as much stuff that they know they're not allowed to do when we're not home. Still, we've never actually tried to film it. Well, some other people did. One person put up a camera and found out that their cat waits for them by the door the whole day while they're gone. Another person who put up a camera found out that their cat cuddles their dog every single day to comfort it when the humans are not home. And today, the couple who decided to film themselves to find out what their cat does when they're asleep… well, let's just say the result is somehow both the most wholesome yet the most hissterical thing you have seen.

Try an attempt that was better, or at least different, than your first… This was not a concept that this recruiter understood, choosing to make the same offer for a second time after this job candidate initially had declined.Who knows what their thought process was? Maybe they were seeking to wear the candidate down in a war of attrition—make the same offer enough times, and they're bound to accept! Perhaps, if they took the Hogwarts school admission department approach and sent 10,000 offers via different delivery services, the candidate would have no choice but to give in and resign to their destiny as the chosen one, manager, or whatever we're talking about here.Regardless, when the candidate shared their experience to Reddit's r/RecruitingHell subreddit, it generated quite a response, sparking discussion about job offers and recruitment in the comments.

5,"Committing to a 6+ hour commute to work every day is a superpower that most of us cannot claim to have. I certainly wouldn't be willing to do that under any circumstance. This Redditer told his impressive tale of malicious compliance, where he beat the system that was designed to fail, after asking his company to reimburse his travel costs. At the time he was living in San Diego, working in Downtown Los Angeles (that's a 175-mile per day commute). He was in the middle of studying for an exam that would allow him to become a licensed Journeyman Electrician and chose to ride the train to gain some study time, instead of driving his car in the difficult LA traffic. He rode a train and a subway to work every day for three entire months. To say he has some incredible tenacity is putting it lightly. This would have cost the company only about $17, had they been willing to be reasonable. But they decided that they were only willing to pay for gas and parking ($50) — if you're raising your eyebrows, join the club. We're all confused.Scroll down to read his detailed account of what happened below. You can also check out these hilariously rare insults.

So, what to do when you're sitting up on your high horse in corporate, and your company is going to miss their annual target of nearly one billion dollars by exactly $75 mil? Who is gonna pay for your third beach house in the Maldives? Action must be taken to prevent the lack of said beach house!One man shared his experience via Reddit, explaining that a few years ago, while the market was down, he was working for a very large (Fortune 100) company that was still making a lot of money because the industry they specialized in was generally profitable. After foreseeing this 'large gap' in revenue, corporate took it upon themselves to cut everyone's paycheck. They didn't take into account human nature, because this industry had a lot of very educated, talented, and dedicated scientists and engineers. What I mean to say is, these people loved their jobs and worked a lot of overtime — just because. When their paychecks were cut, they adopted the natural attitude of 'If you don't care about me, I don't care about you'. The company ended up in shambles. If you're making a lot of money as a company and foresee a small snag, for heaven's sake don't get greedy… your employees should be your priority, not your imaginary beach house.

The Redditor who posted this topic seemed to be letting on to the fact that this rule was instated this year specifically because of this Karen. Keep in mind that this is a private event at a private residence, so it really doesn't stand within the bounds of reason for Karen to have an opinion at all. Luckily the other neighbors quickly put Karen in her place. . . . For more Karens in the wild, check out these Karens who tried to dine and dash after making a stupidly complicated order at a restaurant during closing time.

8,"This IT guy was working for a large firm as a contractor for their IT department. His experience was one that people often have within a giant, bloated corporate behemoth: The managers were unreliable, the expectations were too high, and the company had an odd culture that tried to give you more work, as congratulations for a job well done, rather than pay you fairly.That sounds like something that the owner or CEO thought of one day when they were sitting on the toilet, and all the ""Yes Men"" surrounding them were just too afraid to tell them that that idea should have been flushed along with the other waste. But, the CEO, like many other employers, thought that they could pull this one off; prattling on about their culture, utterly blind to the fact that each and every one of their employees knows exactly what they're doing and hates them for it. The IT guy left after his original notice period was up, despite the fact that the employer had never accepted it. When they called him up on his next shift, wondering where he was, they tried to fire him for no-showing.Keep reading for the full story.

Seriously, I mean I like hash browns but I haven't quite heard of an instance where ordering it as part of a combo or as a separate side could lead to someone getting literally fired. Unfortunately, that's exactly what happened in this scenario. This thread was posted to Reddit's r/TalesFromYourServer subreddit by u/blscratch, who tried to advocate in the customer's best interest. However, this pissed off his manager, who clearly has an anger management issue. After setting the manager off, they started to slowly count out loud from one to ten, as if trying to avoid an outburst. This triggered instant laughter from the Redditor, which in turn triggered an instant dismissal.

10,"If you don't understand what your new subordinates do, it would be a good idea to seek to understand their work. Jumping to baseless conclusions that their work is worthless just because your skull is three inches thick is a surefire way to land the entire organization in hot water. Well, true to typical ""new boss logic,"" this boss, ""Sally,"" was too quick to judge when an essential analyst was restructured under her tyrannical reign. She thought she was cunning and smart when she decided to get rid of the analyst and his pesky salary in order to save the company money. When the analyst organized with HR to delete his files and leave on a six-month redundancy package, he put the final nails in what would become Sally's coffin. Once the files were gone, Sally was in hot water, and the lack of necessary analysis would cost the organization $2.5 million in funding. Keep reading for this classic tale of workplace malicious compliance, as originally posted on the popular Reddit sub.

11,"If it ain't broke, don't fix it! It's common saying that this office place has clearly never heard of. After hiring a secret employee to find the weak parts of this business, the higher-ups made a huge mistake. The OP shared their story to r/pettyrevenge, but in my opinion, this is definitely pro-level revenge. They had the opportunity of a lifetime to show their office place exactly how important they were. Even the strategy the OP had – take 2 weeks vacation ASAP, let the pieces fall where they may – is an exceptionally good way to demonstrate the weight they pull around the office. In the comments, people shared their own funny work revenge/bad boss stories. Sometimes higher ups just don't know how an office functions, and then their interference just makes a smoothly oiled machine start clanking and falling apart. Up next, get the inside scoop on people's anonymous secrets and embarrassing admissions, such as, ""I bought a 5 pack of cheap Polish sausages from Sainsbury's to eat on my way home and it wasn't until I had completely finished the first one that I realized they were individually wrapped in plastic.""

12,"This HR department just wouldn't listen to their employees. U/bolshe-viks-vaporub shared this story of malicious compliance against their own employer. As the OP writes, their company got traded to a DoD contracting company, leading to changes in company policy. For the OP, a hard worker who often worked way more than 40 hours per week, things just weren't adding up. They tried repeatedly to contact the company's HR department about the mistake, but were continually ignored. Finally, they decided to comply with the rules, which this company was definitely not counting on! Commenters noted how odd the discussion around sick days is, and how companies can be stingy with them in the US. Others applauded the OP for their courage to take this all the way to the top to ensure the company really had to comply. Next, these entitled women demanded some seats in a cafe with communal seating — so the OP decided to make the women wait their turn.

Unfortunately there was a MacBook on the cushion, and the OP broke the screen! ""Since it was completely my fault, I offered to pay her the money,"" the OP wrote. But this woman got greedy. She wouldn't accept the OP's money when the time came because she wanted a new computer, complete with the cost increase of hundreds of dollars. She thinks if she's getting a new computer, it should be an upgrade at the OP's expense. Without other options, the OP turned to the internet for advice, and shared what happened as their legal drama played out. Up next, one employee sent out a simple email to 30,000 people by accident — and caused a dramatic email system meltdown.

14,"The job interview process can be incredibly arduous and time-consuming; applying for a new role can be like working a second part-time or full-time job. This is made all the worse by how long it takes most organizations to conduct their interview process; it can be multiple weeks, even months before you know whether or not you have gotten a position you have been interviewing for. Of course, you'd like to think that you have some security once you've signed the contract and are awaiting the start of your first day, but games like this add another element of uncertainty to the mix.This worker was due to start their first day of work at a new job; then, 12 hours before their first shift, they received a message from the employer informing them that they were changing the location of their role.I'll give you one guess as to which industry this job was in… Of course!

Is this how dating works in the modern age? As he explained, he went on a first date with a woman, and it seemed to be going well. But after the date — and spending the night at her place — he realized that she had spilled a little too much information about him. She had researched him beforehand, and just rattled off all this personal information. At the time, the OP thought it was really weird, and asked the Reddit community if she was justified in researching him beforehand.In the comments, the OP did add that what his date found was uncovered from publicly available information, like social media. The things she knew about him, like previous states he'd lived in, could be found that way, but she went even further and dug up information about his whole extended family. In the comments, people were quite divided on if the woman had gone too far, or if she was justified in researching publicly available information.

I definitely won't do it because it costs an exorbitant amount of money, but there's something about the lack of tourism in January and February that makes me extremely curious. When I was growing up, I knew a girl who went to Disney World literally every year during Christmastime. It was excessive, and she still does it to this day. At the time, I always thought it was silly because there are so many less expensive places she could've traveled to. But honestly, now I'm not mad at it.

If you have elementary school-aged kids, you've probably had to go to the store and buy way too many Valentine's Day cards for your kid's classmates. It's fun for the kids, but buying and assembling these cards can be a pain. If you've got some moody middle schoolers, you might be dealing with some candy-gram-related drama. Once you age out of classroom Valentine's Day parties, kids start to send each other flowers and candy through their school. Tensions are high because if your kid doesn't get a candy gram, there might be some tears involved. It's a tough transition from 30 valentines to zero valentines. My favorite part of Valentine's Day when I was a kid was the giant Hershey's Kisses my mom would get for my sister and me.

27,"While we all have different preferences when it comes to work, there's no denying that working from home is becoming an increasingly popular option. Since 2020, the genie has been out of the bottle as far as this flexible arrangement is concerned. Although there can be benefits to going to the office now and then, doing shifts from the comfort of your couch is preferable for many employees. However, plenty of businesses don't see it that way. How else are you going to be micromanaged in a way that kills productivity? It can be mighty annoying to have an employer who refuses to budge on this issue, but one Redditor found a crafty way of making it work for them.After their higher ups forbade them from working their IT job anywhere but the office, they went completely offline and unreachable at home during a snowstorm. The company soon realized that maybe hybrid working wasn't such a bad idea, and the people that read their story were inclined to agree. We don't always need a manager peering over our shoulder eight hours a day.

28,"At this moving company, the boss isn't going to let his employees get taken advantage of. Most rules are there because of previous situations that necessitated them, as this boss proved to his employee. User u/_korvan_ shared a story from their youth, some 30 years ago, when they took a job as a mover at age 16. While there, they had to deal with their fair share of entitled people. The OP shared that they and their boss showed up to one house that had a double door at the front of the house — perfect for the two of them to carry in a sofa bed. But no, not at this Karen's house!This rich woman's workers insisted that there was no way the OP could use those large double doors. Why? Just because Karen said so. Instead, they were directed toward a spiral staircase. Insanity! The OP shared the delicious malicious compliance that followed… always read your contracts, people. Then, read this story of this nurse who just wanted to park their car, but kept getting targeted by their local HOA.

Checking bags and searching for personal belongings is one of these policies. There's no reason for it unless you're dealing with high-security clearance. Why are you so worried that an employee is going to steal a pair of sneakers that were produced at literal slave wages?

Unfortunately, we're stuck on this planet with them, and all we can do is bury our faces in our hands and sigh.Enter: this guy. The guy who didn't know that he'd need to know how to swim to partake in a snorkeling tour. The most hilarious part of this entire thing is that he specifically addresses the fact that he was annoyed the guide wouldn't ""aid"" him—what did he think the guide would do? Operate his arms and legs for him? Possess his body and operate him like a puppet, like some sort of swim-lesson demon? Sorry buddy, the ""possession"" package costs extra—you should have read the fine print. Plus, you must allow enough time at the end of the tour for the end-of-session exorcism.Readers were astounded when screenshots of the review were posted to a popular online community and were delighted to find that the owner had left a scathing response to the reviewer where the review was originally posted. Keep reading to see the review, the operator's response, and the reactions it generated.

31,"If there's one thing Redditors hate, it's parents that call taking care of their children ""babysitting"". If you ever take a childcare issue to Reddit and refer to it as babysitting, you're in for a roasting.And when you ""babysit"" your child so another man can take your wife out to the movies and fancy dinners instead of you? Prepare to be incinerated.Such was the case of OP, who wondered if he was the a$$hole for asking to be paid to watch his daughter and the neighbor's daughters while the neighbor showed his wife a good time.The initial reason for the neighbor and wife hanging out made sense—OP's wife loves horror films, OP can't stand them, the neighbor enjoys them as well. But when the neighbor upped his game and started taking the wife out for fancy dinners and paying for them, OP should have set a hard boundary.Instead, OP used this as an excuse to absolve himself of any couple activities since going out with said neighbor kept his wife fully satisfied (we, and every commentator on this post, bet she is).OP has been met with a barrage of criticism and a few raised eyebrows, and a unanimous YTA vote.

32,"I'm going to come out and say it: Loving what you do (for work) is a luxury. But even if you're a statistics enthusiast or a strategy geek, chances are you don't want to spend all your time working. That's where having a work/life balance comes in. The concept, to many, is pretty novel. It's long been fashionable to spend long hours working in the office or from home, putting in the extra time because your bosses, for some reason, expect you to be available around the clock. There's a reason those '90s workaholic parents were such a common trope. It's because our society has nurtured this unhealthy existence. While we don't usually hear CEOs or other bigwigs saying that people should work more, every now and then one of them screws up and reveals their true (ugly) colors. Thanks to the r/antiwork subreddit, we see more of these instances than we used to. Just a couple of weeks ago, one Scott Kuru - CEO of Freedom Property Investors, shared a particularly damning bit of wisdom on the corporate cringe fest that is LinkedIn. The post starts off with a bang: 'Never hire anyone that's looking for work life balance' Things get more annoying from there.

34,"Cats… cats can be incredibly smart sometimes. Like- yes, yes, they all have their dumb moments, and we love those, but they really shock us with how intelligent they can be sometimes. We've seen cats do all kinds of things that require cunning - like the cat who enters a lock code into a door every day to get inside the house or the or the cat who robbed a supermarket and stole 3 sausages - exactly 3. We know that cats understand patterns, they read reactions, and that once they want something, they will find a way to drive us crazy and get it. So, when we see a story about a smart cat doing something amazing, from experience, we tend to not question it. And it seems that the rest of the internet is in agreement with us. That's why when this post went up - about a cat who brings a leaf to a shop owner every day to exchange it for fish, the internet ate it up.

35,"This job seems to check all the boxes of a toxic work environment. Reading this epic tale of malicious compliance is like coming across one red flag after another. This thread was posted to Reddit's r/MaliciousCompliance subreddit by u/Current-Fly8346, who began working for this family-run operation while in college. Pretty quickly, they started taking on more responsibilities with no pay bump. They also got a friend (Katy) hired and didn't receive their promised referral bonus. The CEO and his wife accused the Redditor and Katy of talking too much in the office, so when they fully separated themselves from one another, they also stopped communicating about projects, thereby making their productivity, well, less productive. Eventually, Katy voiced concerns about how the business was run and was unfairly fired. Rather than take on her duties, the Redditor decided that enough was enough and refused to be responsible for any more than what was included in her job description. Eventually, the company's sales began to suffer, and the higher-ups began to take notice.

38,"Finding a good manager, one that isn't a toxic leader who gives you work-PTSD, isn't easy. When you find a place with a boss that treats everybody with respect and helps elevate everybody, then you hold onto them tight. Unfortunately, that is not what this employee did and when he realized what he did, he knew karma was coming for him. This guy took to Reddit to confess his horrible actions. He has been working at his place of establishment for almost a decade. He got a new boss right before the pandemic and she was the best. He actually started to love working, started to improve in his job, and even got a promotion. His new manager was always there for him when he needed and he was very happy with the new leadership. However, one day, his manager got Covid and she suffered longterm effects. She started being less attentive because of it, and he got annoyed. The boss of his boss came to him and asked him about the performance of his manager, and he was upset and vented everything to him. He says in the moment he thought that his boss was asking him about his manager because he wanted to help her. But it turns out he wanted a reason to fire her, and he served it up to him on a silver platter. After she was fired, the guy hated his job. He had to work more directly with the boss who fired his favorite manager and he turned out to be the worst. When they finally did hire someone to replace the old manager, he was also the worse. Because of everything, his own performance has suffered and believes he is now also on a track to being fired. He had his epiphany and confessed to Redditors about his backstabbing actions and his regrets, but the internet does not go easy on him. Read it all below.

39,"Moral of the story: don't live right next to a school. This is a universal truth for a number of reasons. First, one can imagine that there would be a ton of noise. Second, where there are schools, there are children and children are a nuisance (unless, that is, they are your own, in which case they are a cute nuisance). Finally, as this thread from Reddit's r/entitledparents subreddit confirms, there's the issue of parking during drop-off and pickup times. That's exactly what this Redditor experienced when they discovered an entitled Mom's car clearly parked on their private property. Sure, their energy might have been a tad aggressive given that the entitled Mom's kid was present, but rules are rules and this original poster was certainly justified in threatening to call the police. Blocking her car to make matters worse, however, might have been a tad petty, but it proved a very important point.

As an engineer working underneath a senior engineer, the OP thought they had a pretty good relationship with their boss. The OP writes that they had a good rapport and talked about their lives quite often. However, the OP unfortunately is learning that the workplace isn't quite like real life, and lots of people implement strong work and life separation policies. In the comments, people mainly blamed the OP here. OP seems more naive than bad-intentioned. It seems like a stretch that they would get fired for recording their boss playing video games. As some commenters noted, the boss might immediately feel like OP is holding this over his head, which wouldn't be good for their power dynamic. After you scroll through this awkward work interaction, check out this person who was scammed into an interview, and sent the interviewers a strongly worded message about their experience.

This can be incredibly difficult to get your head around, providing a much more difficult philosophical dilemma than whether or not someone is wrong for stealing their roommate's cat. The idea of doing harm to prevent a greater one brings a certain trolley problem to mind: Is it wrong to do something bad if it prevents something worse?The internet certainly seemed to think so, declaring this friend, who sought to warn her friend of their boyfriend's surprise proposal to avert her disappointment, to be the ""a**hole"" in this situation. Let's be honest here, the boyfriend doesn't seem to be a particular ray of sunshine; perhaps the friend would be better off without him, but these aren't decisions we get to meddle in or make for others.What's your take?

Rubeus Hagrid, Arthur Weasley, Albus Dumbledore, Remus Lupin, Sirius Black, and arguably Severus Snape looked after Harry in a way his father no longer could. Hagrid made him and his friends tea, Lupin taught him how to ward off dementors, and Snape bullied him relentlessly until it was finally revealed his intentions were good, actually!

(It's no wonder that, in these industries, you spend most of your time off just trying to recover from adrenal fatigue.)Yes, customers are entitled and demanding, sometimes making demands for things that don't even actually exist. When this happens, your manager will probably get involved and tell them to jog on in the nicest way possible…. Unless your manager is Steve.

When you're a kid entering the workforce (If I may call it that), you are probably going to be taken advantage of, salary-wise. Today, being a paperboy isn't as prevalent as it was back in the day before we could access the News on any and all digital devices. Thirty years ago, newspapers in the suburbs were delivered by kids on bicycles. The weather could be rough, but rain or shine, the kid would load the papers into a delivery bag, and ride off in the cold wee hours of the morning, hurling them at the front doors of the homes in the neighborhood. The routes were always relatively close to home. The strain these heavy bags had on the kids' shoulders was brutal.Now, to our point. Bosses back then were no better than they are now. It's nothing new that they try to trick you into doing more work, for exactly the same amount of pay. When you're a kid, you're even less likely to speak up. So if you were efficient, you were rewarded with more work — or picked up the slack of others, and your paycheck remained the same.A woman took to Reddit, recounting a tale of malicious compliance she'd had back in the day when she would deliver papers. Her boss thought she could sneak in extra work, requiring more hours from the deliverer, without proper compensation — assuming naively that she'd get away with it. Ah well, that's what malicious compliance is for, right?Scroll down for the full story — I've provided all the screenshots you need.

55,"If you had to describe yourself on the spot, would you include your profession in the description? It kind of makes sense if you're really passionate about what you do, and/or your job is something prestigious or interesting. Still, it's likely that most of us would not jump to our job title to when it comes to explaining who we are.It's pretty crazy, then, that so much of our lives relate to our workplace. Just because we've got to do this whole working thing to survive doesn't mean that we have to be grateful for it. As we all know, it's difficult to feel like that a lot of the time anyway. Memes might not magically make our work-based woes improve, but they can make them easier to deal with. That's why there are such a lot of them out there. We need to express the frustration somehow.

Or do you slink back and pretend that you can't hear the conversation?This friend, ""Jessica,"" chose the former and got herself a (reluctant) invitation to the trip by ""publicly shaming"" her mutual friend that was planning the trip. Information was shared regarding the cost and the itinerary of the trip, but things started to go sour as soon as the trip started. ""Things started to go south the moment she arrived here,"" the friend writes of Jessica in a story posted to Reddit's r/AmItheA**hole subreddit. The friend continues that Jessica caused multiple issues and dramas: demanding to be picked up from the airport at a different time and complaining about costs that had already been communicated. Things escalated and culminated with Jessica being kicked out of the house.That's where the original thread wraps, with the friend, Redditor u/LucyAriaRose, wondering if she was in the wrong for her part in the confrontation.The friend then returned with an update to share what had happened since their original post, detailing their near reconciliation, which fell apart when their offer to reimburse Jessica for their accommodation was taken advantage of.. . . Next, check out this story where a bride wanted her friend to contribute financially to her wedding.

59,"Every cat is unique. No matter the color, the breed, the age, every single cat will have some weird and unique habit that truly makes them special. But, we have to admit that some groups of cats also have things in common. Like the amazing and beautiful void cats. What they have in common is that they fade in the background of dark couches, and you will accidentally sit on them in the middle of the night and have a heart attack… at least once. And the stunning and special hairless cats. Well, there is a chance, small as it may be, that you might confuse them with a raw chicken. You'll figure it out before anything bad happens, but you'll get a little spooked anyway. And then, there are orange cats. The thing that they have in common is that… all orange cats share one braincell. One. Together. They're… special. Unique! And you know what, as much as we love smart cats and their shenanigans, we looove dumb orange cats, so here's an ode to them.

60,"Trick a worker into quitting their job and joining your organization, then they're well and truly trapped when you cut their pay by 50%… Talk about a cunning trap. That's exactly what this worker shared experiencing in a post shared to Reddit's r/antiwork subreddit community. In a post titled '50% salary decrease…', they discussed the situation. ""My new job just cut my salary by $30k, only a couple months into the job."" the post begins, ""I was making $65k, and now I'm making $35k LOL. They tried to gaslight me into thinking I wasn't experienced enough for the role, but that's BS because I was making $60k in a comparable role before taking on this job.""That sounds like a pretty rough situation, especially to go from earning $60k at the previous job to thinking you'll be earning $65k in the foreseeable future only to have the rug pulled out from under you and go to earning half your previous wage. This has to be illegal somehow; this employer has stolen this guy's entire life. Absolutely this guy shouldn't have signed the new contract, but what else would you do in that situation? The only thing he can really do is go crawling back to his old employer… This is why you don't burn bridges, folks.If that wasn't an option, it's safe to say that you probably still wouldn't stay at that job for any longer than you had to. Still, the job application and interview process can take a painful amount of time and energy—especially when you're working a full-time job.  Readers let their thoughts be known in the comments, encouraging the worker to strike back at the employer by quitting with no notice as soon as they had found another job—others had even more out-the-gate suggestions.Keep scrolling to see the screenshots of the original post.

62,"This dude created a wave of malicious compliance seemingly by accident! He was standing up to his boss after getting his time docked fifteen minutes for being just one minute late. This new policy proved to be ridiculous, and so the Redditor decided he wouldn't work for free during those fifteen minutes, knowing that it's fully illegal to require workers to do so. When his coworkers saw this tactic work, they all followed suit and it was only a matter of time before their horrible boss was called out by his boss for enforcing a policy that led to decreased productivity. This thread, which was shared to Reddit's r/MaliciousCompliance subreddit, is a mostly positive tale of worker solidarity… that is until the original poster revealed that his boss got his own revenge not much later. Thankfully, according to his responses in the comments section below, he found a better job at a competing company afterward.

65,"There's this thing that occasionally happens in workplaces, universally, across every industry, when management takes a look at their books and realizes how much they're paying workers in overtime. Commence initiative: Overtime approval—requiring workers to endure ridiculous approval processes to beat them into submission until they don't bother reporting overtime that they're working. The extra work still gets done, and costs don't increase. Job done.The perplexingly confounding thing about organizations that go this route is that they almost always have a culture of forcing workers to work overtime to cover for chronic understaffing, dodging the pesky costs associated with having more workers on the payroll in the first place. That's all fine and dandy, but there's a reason these organizations suffer high rates of burnout and high turnover. However, depending on how fed up your workers are with this transparent circus you're running, there's another way that this can go: They stop working overtime. Now you're stuck in a game of cat and mouse where your workers are technically doing exactly what you asked, but projects are falling by the wayside.That's pretty much what we have in this workplace story of malicious compliance.

Blue collar workers in trade know that has a GD fact. Recently, a construction worker took to Reddit to share their own satisfying story where they got to serve their very own piping hot plate of karma to a toxic ex-coworker. So this guy worked at a construction company and was fine until they brought one of the owner's entitled nephew's onboard. This guy seemed to be a text book jerk. Short tempered, blame everyone else for everything, and was just an all around unpleasant guy. Not to mention is seems like he was always trying his darnedest to get other people in trouble with the company. This eventually got the Reddit poster fired. Fortunately, the Reddit went to their competitors and quickly got a better job there. About a year later his boss comes up to him and asks him about an application he was looking into. It would seem someone he used to work with was now applying there. He looked at the application and low and behold it was his a-hole ex-coworker. Turns out his epic jerkness ended up getting him fired by his own uncle.Now, karma was at the tip of his fingers and all he had to do was press the button. He didn't hesitate to tell his now-boss exactly what he thought about this applicant and every reason why he should definitely not be hired.Read the entire satisfying justice served below!

Or what about this one: ""I'm going to wait until I'm 30 to have a kid so I can enjoy my twenties."" These lines of reasoning are predicated on the notion that having kids is not enjoyable and is something you want to be relieved of eventually or postpone.

But alas, that's exactly what happened to u/wastingtimaway, who shared this thread on Reddit's r/MaliciousCompliance subreddit.  Here's how it all went down. Karen asked for two quesadillas that were gluten-free, dairy-free, vegan, basically all the things. Of course, we sympathize with folks who have dietary restrictions; that's not the issue here. The issue was that the Redditor anticipated that if they rang up the order as two quesadillas, it would still be $24 despite the missing ingredients. They tried to help the customer out by asking if she wanted a lettuce wrap instead or something else that would be more bang for her buck, so to speak. Nope! She was insistent that she wanted the two quesadillas her way and was particularly rude about it. So you can imagine her shock when she saw that the price hadn't changed. Our opinion?

71,"It's really easy nowadays to pirate software, which is probably why everybody does it, including big companies that can easily afford to buy the original. Of course, there are those anti-pirating-angels, who wish to wear their halos for all to see — which begs the question, why (besides taking cash into account) don't we download the genuine version of the software? Why are we so quick to dismiss it?The reason is actually pretty simple. You can't run the stupid thing without an internet connection, and sometimes you gotta download another piece of software for it to work — then you have to create a freaking account, log into the new account on the second piece of software… and patiently await the installation process, which takes forever. In other words, it's a headache. So we'd rather risk the big fines that come along with avoiding said headache. @doriangrey433 took to Reddit to share their frustrating experience with their former boss, who called some 6 months after the user had finished working at the company, accusing them of reporting the company's use of illegally downloaded software.Imma be real with y'all… before you begin accusing somebody of reporting your illegal activity, you should probably begin with small talk. Y'know, be nice. Ask the ex-employee how they're doing at their new job. Maybe add a 'How's the wife? Kids going to school yet?'. Because there is a small chance that they didn't actually report you, but they certainly will if you're being a jerk.Scroll down to read the hilarious detailed account below.

This is the theory that most full-time workers have only four hours of freedom per day after subtracting work, commuting, personal duties, and sleep from the equation.It's hard to make those hours count when we've got our jobs to be concerned with, as most of us learn all too soon in the journey of adulthood. As a result, we've got to steal back those extra moments whenever we can. Looking at memes is the perfect way to do this; it can be subtle enough to do on the clock, and it's entertaining, too.

81,"This employee just did what they were told to do... What happens when you realize your coworker gets paid 20% more than you and you ask your horrible boss if you can get paid equally, especially considering how much extra work you have been taking on? Well, apparently, your horrible boss tells you to get a competitive offer somewhere else to justify your request for a raise… Ok, boss. You got it. This thread, which was posted to Reddit's r/MaliciousCompliance subreddit by u/inertzero, shows how pointless and unproductive these kinds of negotiations are… because what happened when the employee complied and got that competitive offer? They went ahead and took it! And now their horrible boss has to find a new employee willing to take on all those extra responsibilities that the Redditor took on. We doubt that it will be an easy search.  Keep scrolling below for the full story. For more, check out this post about an employee's PTO request getting revoked.

You make sure everything is perfect and wouldn't dare do anything gross around him. Fast forward a few months in - or even to marriage and that's all history. You're happy to take off your make up in front of him, hell - he'll be lucky if you even put any on to begin with, you're peeing with the bathroom door open, and maybe even already farting in front of him.Sound familiar?

83,"All of us have coping mechanisms, whether we admit it or not. It goes without saying that some of these are more harmful than others, especially when they lead down the slippery slope of addiction. In the grand scheme of things, needing a dose of memes in our lives every day is one of the less terrible ones. In fact, we can kind of market it to ourselves as a comfort. When we've just had a long, hard day, or we're just about to begin one, the memes can offer a respite that doesn't hit the same coming from anywhere else. Stupid entertainment really is the best medicine, even when we're not sick. It can heal that bad mood we didn't even know we were in, and all it requires is a couple of minutes of attention. There aren't many things that are capable of working a little miracle like that.

These policies have usually only been thought out as far as giving the enforcing party a much-desired ego boost; as such, they won't hold any water when placed to the test and have light shed upon them. When these teachers found themselves faced with a ridiculous policy from an authoritative principal, they did their very best to follow that policy to the letter. One of the teachers, Redditor u/Middle_Pound_822, shared their story on Reddit's r/MaliciousCompliance subreddit, drawing support and commendation from readers.

91,"If you're one of the millions of people who were born before the ubiquity of smartphones, you might feel like you're getting old when you go online. When I scroll through TikTok, and I see countless videos that are ⅓ Family Guy clips, ⅓ ASMR slime video, and ⅓ Subway Surfer gameplay, I wonder if I'm out of touch with the youngest generation of online users. Luckily, I don't think that the millennials and elder Gen Zers have anything to worry about. We were lucky enough to grow up during a time when we weren't constantly stimulated by various algorithmic forces. We were allowed to be bored when we were kids, which served us well. We are far more internet savvy than the kids who have been staring at their phone screens since they were in diapers; We know a life where we had to wait 10 minutes for something to load, and that's a character-building experience Generation Alpha could only dream about.

The problem is, most of us are so used to the routine of setting an alarm and then grinding that we would probably feel lost in the endless possibilities of full time unemployment. The truth is that not having a job would not necessarily allow us to be constantly lazy. Just look at the schedule of the average stay-at-home mom. Still, it would free us from a whole world of minor annoyances, that in the grand scheme of things don't deserve the time and emotion we invest in them.

What's so different about my child versus someone else's human pet?

94,"The concept of modern-day influencers has been a thing for a while now. What is this strange phenomenon that has taken over the WWW? They swarm every social media platform that exists, and it has become impossible not to encounter them while scrolling. Well, influencers, as the title suggests, influence others. They have a distinct niche (All look the same to me… fashion, shmashion…), and they actively engage with their… followers. Y'know, like a biblical prophet.They have also gained a bad repp for being incredibly self-involved, pretentious, entitled, and… cheap. Personally, I can't understand it. If you're getting a free meal that's worth $700, HOW can you cheap out on leaving a tip?! That's what this influencer did though… in fact, I find that leaving $5 is worse than leaving no tip at all.

98,"One of the fastest-known ways to distribute serotonin around the world is through memes. They have been around for a hot second, and over the course of time, they have become an empire — devoted to humor. There are many categories, one of them being 'classical art memes'. See, art and humor mix together like a good ol' peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Our ancestors are likely squirming in their graves, appalled by our 'lack of respect' towards their artwork. They likely would not be down with the humor of this digital generation.We can actually argue that the general population has become more exposed to works of art, therefore they are widely available to be admired, instead of collecting dust in a museum. Basically, they have become relevant again. The stoic, sullen expressions on the faces of these memes, along with the cleverly written relatable quotes make this particular meme a part of the Elite.

99,"A big problem in a lot of businesses is that they don't really understand what their employees do all day. Ask any member of upper management to give a detailed description of what one of their minor subordinates does, and they would probably struggle. This is part of the reason that so many people see their hard work go unrecognized (well, that and the fact they don't want to pay anyone more).It can lead to some pretty frustrating misunderstandings, and even some grave mistakes. Of course, it's usually the lower ranked workers that are expected to be on the receiving end of this. One of many people who has had to experience this first hand is u/Edymnion. When a company they used to work for got taken over by a bigger organization, their team was sent a fresh employee meant to absorb their knowledge and allow them to lay off a number of more established people. So, they found a way to make the process as tricky as possible. Posting the story to r/MaliciousCompliance, Redditors celebrated the canny way in which everyone had saved their jobs.

101,"There is no doubting a hooman's love for their pets, it's painfully obvious wherever they go. Most cat owners have a photo of their gooberish cat as the home screen on their phone. Others can't endure a conversation without mentioning their beloved Mr. Snoofalupaguss. And some cat owners even have those tiny backpacks with a clear globe on the back, so they can bring their gato with them wherever they go. Aww… What's more wholesome than that? Cats on the other hand, are a bit harder to read than their hoomans. Do they love us? Or do they simply tollerate human existence because it means that they have an army of enormous slaves at their disposal? We're not entirely sure.

Sometimes, they have to eat yucky vegetables and finish the year of playing with their soccer team, even though they wanted to quit halfway through. However, there's a point where parents need to listen to what their kids are saying and act accordingly. One mother took to Reddit to ask whether she was the villain for forcing her teenage daughter to wear dresses when going over to their grandparent's house. There is usually an easy solution when you want your tomboy daughter to wear something nice to a formal event; You get her a suit or a pantsuit. Bam, perfect compromise! Unfortunately, these kids aren't forced to wear dresses because they're going to the ballet or church. Their grandparents are so ""traditional"" they get upset when they see girls wearing pants in any context.

Your kitty might show you that they love you by laying on your lap (now you can't move to go to the bathroom). Your gato might show their affection with a kneady tummy cuddle or a flick of their tail. Cats might even show their affection when they stare at you, with unblinking eyes, from their perch on the highest shelf in the room. They're either looking out for you and watching your back, or their plotting their aerial attack. That's the thing with cats, they always keep you on your toes– and that's why we love them.

114,"There's a significant lack of consistency in the pay scales of many organizations — especially small businesses. You may be running the entire day-to-day operation of the business, pushing (unsuccessfully) for a raise for years, only to discover that the guy your boss has just hired to make Tik-Tok videos is making more money than you.

115,"There's often a lot of anxiety that comes with the decision to quit your current job and start a new one. We're creatures of habit and comfort by nature, so thrusting yourself into the unknown isn't easy. So many uncertainties come with a new job that you can't help your imagination wander into wild territories. Will the new job be worse? What will my new boss be like? Will I be any good at my new job? Will I fail catastrophically? Will I regret leaving? It's safe to say that, despite these fears, if you're unhappy with your current circumstances, then it's always worth venturing out into something new. Who knows? Maybe it will blow up in your face, and you'll have to come crawling back, but at least you can say that you tried.But to start your new job, there's one thing you must do first: quit your old one, which is not an easy thing to do. It's a tough conversation, and there's no telling how some people might react. Generally, you'd expect your employer to ask you to consider staying on or just an amicable split; some less professional and more volatile managers might take it personally and lose their cool, but what do you do if they just say ""No""? That's what happened when Redditor u/WorthlessFloor decided to quit their job and received a response from their employer that they had committed to a required minimum of 1 year with the company. They posted their situation and screenshots of the email to Reddit's r/antiwork subreddit in order to seek advice. After some clarification from the poster, readers advised them to check their employment agreement and become familiar with the laws of their state; the reader sent an email to their employer advising them of their rights, returning to the subreddit to share an update as to what had happened since their original post. Keep reading for this combination of the two threads.

117,"Smokers often attract the attention of their coworkers due to the obscene number of ""short"" breaks they take to ""step outside"" for a moment and satisfy their addiction. From the perception of their desk-bound coworkers, these breaks often total obscene amounts of time over the course of weeks or months. To make matters worse, when the boss smokes too, it can often feel like you're falling behind and being disadvantaged when it comes to the complex socio-political inter-workings of corporate life. But let's be honest here—how many of us are guilty of taking small breaks from our work to browse Reddit, check on our other socials, or just… dissociate. No one in an office is working for their full eight hours; that's the type of torture reserved for retail workers and the service industry. If this worker only managed to accrue $200 worth of ""stolen"" time over the course of months and years—well… they might be one of the most responsible smokers I've witnessed; they might even be one of the most responsible workers I've seen. Period. That didn't stop their workplace from firing them after an internal loss prevention audit. As readers have commented, it's likely that someone somewhere had it out for them already, or they were just being scapegoated and made as an example to try and increase the productivity of other workers. All is well that ends well; the original poster returned with an update-edit to their post, sharing that they had been hired back as a supervisor at a previous employer. . . . Keep reading to see the original post below. For more, check out this employee that quit after being ridiculed by their boss when they donated their time on their day off to help the boss's friend.

118,"If you mess around on the internet, you're going to find out what happens! These people all got hilariously roasted after trying to dunk on someone. It gives you such a feeling of schadenfreude to see people try to say something incorrect, and then get dunked on for it. Although there aren't too many brands doing the dunking this time around, they're occasionally the most vicious of posters (because the writer gets to hide behind the brand name)! In this instance, Game Stop roasted one person who made an innocent comment, probably not expecting to get dunked on.  Next up, check out this unfortunate lottery winner.

There are a lot of people out there hoping on that special someone, but a lot of them also don't want to put in the work it takes to have a good relationship. For proof of this, all we have to do is see the things that happen on the average dating app. While countless happy couples now meet on Tinder or similar (I've even seen them with my own eyes), there are millions of other individuals who fail to be so lucky. One of the reasons for this is that many people don't seem to know how to act when they're on the apps. There's something about messaging strangers that we want to bone that makes for some deeply cringeworthy moments.

Turns out cats have existential crisis too, so that's great news to all of us with anxiety! We wonder what they're thinking about though - are they having a sudden realization of self-existence? Did they suddenly remember something they wanted to do in the middle of the night, but forgot?We'll never know what they're questioning, but seeing them in a state of panic somehow makes us feel like we have a slightly better grip on our own lives. We wish we could tell them to let go of their anxiety and just live in the meowment, but something always gets lost in translation. Guess we'll just have to cuddle them against their will instead.

126,"Never bite off more than you can chew! That's what these other servers learned after they accused this waitress of always getting the best section of the restaurant on Sundays. Once management brought it to the attention of the waitress, she gave up her section, knowing there was no way these other people could handle managing ten tables at once. As it turns out, she was right. This thread was posted to Reddit's r/MaliciousCompliance subreddit by u/iwasthechubbylady, and while we don't necessarily support this kind of competition in the workplace, the real takeaway here is to know how much you can handle before overdoing it. The Redditor worked at the restaurant for five years and clearly got into a rhythm there. She also mentioned that this scenario occurred multiple times during the course of her employment at the restaurant, and every time, the other servers wound up giving her section back to her.

127,"Let's face it — memes have become an empire devoted to humor, and their modern rule on humankind is undeniable. Globalization has allowed memes to get from one end of the earth to the other with little difficulty. There are endless categories, each unique in its own way — and this specific category is elite. Classical art and memes go together like peanut butter and jelly — they just work. Our ancestors are most likely squirming around in the afterlife, whispering furiously amongst one another, vowing to get revenge. How dare we spoil classical art with funny quotes and swear words? We can just hear them, 'Pffft, kids these days!', appalled at our lack of respect. We could argue that thanks to memes, the younger generation is actually being exposed to this beautiful classical art, but we imagine this argument would be shot down with a lot of 'THUS FAR' and 'THOUGH SHALT NOT' kind of talk that we wouldn't really get, what with our modern day slang.So, without further ado, scroll down for the best memes of the week in the classical art department.

Somebody who knows this all too well is @devinraimo, who was traumatized from her experience of a high flying corporate job straight out of college. Sharing to TikTok the crazy sacrifices she was expected to make for the company, viewers were horrified by her story.

He posted this thread to Reddit's r/AmITheA**hole subreddit and after a bit of clarification, it became crystal clear that he was very much not the jerk in this situation.  Here's the breakdown of what happened: wife was upset that her husband would bring dirt into the house after a long day of work in the garage or in the yard. Super understandable. However, he has to come into the house because the bathroom just inside their back door never has enough soap in it. When husband tries to refill the dispensers in that bathroom, wife gets upset and starts hiding soap from him. Husband goes to get his own soap to use for refilling, but she finds that and hides that soap from him too.

After being told by their manager that they were to only sell coffee in one size (12oz), they were later shamed by that very same manager in front of a customer for not using a larger size (30z) meant for soda orders. What happened next was something only a Redditor well-versed in malicious compliance could pull off.  This thread was posted to Reddit's r/MaliciousCompliance subreddit by u/pressurecrocker, who explained that in order to get some sweet, petty revenge, they began to use the larger soda size every single time a customer suggested that they would want something larger than the 12oz coffee cup. That meant that they were brewing a ton of free coffee, but the manager couldn't get too mad considering that the Redditor was doing exactly what the manager shamed them into doing during that earlier encounter. There's nothing better than pointing out your manager's flaws by doing exactly what they told you to do. Keep scrolling below to read the full story.

141,"If you ask a random Harry Potter fan off the street what they think of Severus Snape, chances are you will get a strong opinion. Get 100 Potterheads in a room, and there's a chance none of them will share the exact same take on Snape. Over the years, fan opinions have slowly but surely turned against Snape. While some still view him as a hero, it's a lot more common for people to see him as no more than a common villain who was needlessly cruel to an abused child because he still has a crush on his dead mom. I believe it is more complicated than that. Snape did sacrifice his life in the fight against Voldemort and, in many ways, had Harry's best interest at heart. He's hard to love and understand, but that's what makes him such an interesting character. If you're still trying to decide how you perceive Snape, then you'll love the following Harry Potter memes.

143,"In theory, most full time workers spend just under quarter of the average week doing their jobs. Why, then, does it feel like our whole lives are taken up by them? Between unexpected overtime, commuting, and the ever-present inbox, switching off from our work is not as easy as it should be. Neither is staying focused when we're there, because human beings were not designed to be boxed up looking at spreadsheets for eight hours a day. While it may be possible to (occasionally) get a feeling of satisfaction from our jobs, we're more frequently up against the many annoyances and minor existential crises that they bring. They may pay our bills, but the payoff often doesn't feel worth it. This is why there is a whole internet industry out there based on amusing, work-based complaints. If we can't make things better, at least we can make them kind of funny.

144,"What this boss says goes, so this employee just did exactly as his manager asked him. Some bosses just always have to be right, no matter what their employees say. U/oldman712 shared this excellent tale of malicious compliance, and commenters then shared their own tales below. As the OP wrote, he was a software prototype designer who usually worked with individual clients. He'd save their projects on various terabytes, which the actually bought with his own money! While the OP cared about his clients, new management entered the picture, and they began cutting costs. Due to age discrimination, the OP was forced out of his job, and even had to train his replacement. But by following his company's rules to the letter, he ended up having the last laugh. Next up, this introvert just got a new coworker who's friendly and talkative — and they have the exact same commute every single day.

145,"There's nothing like building up a small business with your boss only to have them sell it… leaving your job in the hands of a greedy egomaniac who cares about nothing except making good on their investment. This new owner will often think that they know how to run your business better than you and manage your clients better than you—all while downplaying your experience and contributions to ""put you in your place.""This often results in an incredibly predictable outcome; without knowing the nuances of the business or industry and the connections required, there's really only one way it can go.This is a story of exactly this scenario with exactly this outcome.

If you're a serious WFH fiend who capitalizes on all the wonderful introvert pleasures of your apartment, you probably even have an oscillating schedule of daytime pajamas and nighttime pajamas. ERM. THERE'S A DIFFERENCE.Besides, if there's one thing that becoming a work from home employee has taught you, is that life was much harder before you had constant access to all of the comforts of home.

148,"It might not seem like it with all the toxic workplaces being ousted left and right and workers finally realizing they deserve more respect and quitting. But there are still some good work environments in this world and when you find one, you gotta appreciate it. Recently, a man on Reddit posted about how he was publicly called out during a work dinner, but the story has a plot twist. He starts by saying his boss left for a three-week vacation and dumped his workload onto him. So he not only had to do his own work, he now had to also do the work of his boss. He said the entire three weeks he felt overwhelmed and like he was not doing well, even though he was giving it his all and doing the best he could. The work day before his boss returned he attended a company dinner with all the employees, higher-ups, etc. The Junior CEO went on stage and went through the company basics, but then transitioned to the ""complaint box."" This was highly unusually, because those are kept anonymous. So you can imagine the shock and horror this man felt when she started to read the ""complaint"" from the box and it started with this man's first and last name. However, it wasn't a complaint at all, it was a praise. It called him out for being a great hardworking employee. Apparently, his co-workers noticed how much effort and time he was putting into his work and wanted to let him know they all appreciated him for it. The man had recently gotten a bonus, so the company ended up giving him a stipend to be used for his choice of an extra vacation day, fuel gift card, or several other options. Read the entire story below::

149,"Family weddings always lead to drama, one way or another. This time, a woman took to the r/AITA subreddit, seeking Redditers' opinions about her 'selfish sister' who was getting married, and picked a venue that wasn't up to par with this woman's expectations regarding wheelchair accessibility. See, the woman's daughter had disabilities, and the wedding would be held at the beach, in the sand. That is not exactly wheelchair friendly…To be fair and even out the playing field a little, it's important I mention that the venue did in fact have the option to rent a wheelchair that is designed specifically to endure sand — this option came at the cost of $110. This woman simply didn't want to pay it. Commenters came to her sister's defense, and after careful inspection, it's not hard to see why.Scroll down to give it a read.

150,"This was a rare instance in which the lady who asked to speak to the manager was not a Karen! In fact, the manager at the store was the real jerk here, as he accused the customer of trying to purchase wine for someone underage. He kept on insisting that the customer walked into the store with someone else, even though she kept on insisting and proving that she came in alone and that she herself was over 21. Still, the manager would not relent and would not let her buy the special wine she drove 60 miles to procure. So what happened next? Well, let's just say it was the kind of epic petty revenge only someone with the ability to make a temporary $10K purchase could enact. Still, it was epic nonetheless, and the Redditor did get her money back in the end. She shared her story via this thread on Reddit's r/pettyrevenge subreddit, and if you keep scrolling below, you can see exactly how she pulled it all off.

This waitress shared her story of the time she refused to let her coworkers get stiffed on their tip, and it's an awesome tale of pettiness succeeding! As the OP shared to r/Talesfromyourserver, it was a slow day at her restaurant, so it already wasn't the best day for earning tips. At the end of the night, the OP encountered one couple on a date. While the couple was enjoying their date, they decided not to tip, and that was just not going to fly with the OP! Scroll down to read this waitress's surprising method of shaming her customer into tipping.  Then, check out these unholy coffee drinks with way too much cream, sugar, and flavoring, leading us to believe these beverages are entirely cursed.

152,"Working your way up in a company usually means ending up in a middle management position at least for a good little while. Starting from the bottom of the pyramid means you have a longer way to work up, but it isn't impossible. So you work hard and harder until it would be absolutely bonkers for you not to make your way to the top of the pyramid. However, some people skip some steps in a very unfair way because of nepotism. If you don't know what nepotism is, it's basically when people get hire or promoted not because they are good employees but because they are related in some way. It's whack. This is exactly what happened to one employee who recently took to Reddit to express his frustrations. The guy had been working at the company for several years now. He worked his hardest and was sure he would get the promotion he deserved. It seemed obvious to him and all his coworkers. However, when the position became available, the higher ups went around his back and hired a different person. He thought maybe they hired someone who just simply was better for the job, which he could accept. However, he found out that the person who stole his promotion was just a nepo-baby from a family with money who has political pull in the company. The new manager is extremely inexperienced and has no idea what he is doing and the employee who worked hard for years is rightful upset. Read all about it below.

Everybody has questions about how Gilderoy Lockhart was able to get hired at Hogwarts in the first place. My favorite Harry Potter plot hole pertains to everybody's favorite game: Quidditch. I really question the viability of Quidditch as a game. I know that in the Quidditch World Cup, the golden snitch is less critical because the other positions score so high. But that begs to question: does Quidditch only work when there are professionals on the brooms? At Hogwarts, every game really just comes down to the seeker, which makes the other positions feel utterly futile. This could really be a two-man sport, but J.K. Rowling decided to give Ron, Draco, Ginny, and of course, Oliver Wood, something to do. How generous of her.

The contract tends to have a more tangible effect on ensuring that both parties hold up the ends of the deal, but still, there are employers that see fit to flout the written terms of these agreements. That's what this electrical apprentice faced when their boss saw fit to deny them their guaranteed annual increase in pay, citing performance issues and issues in the business as the cause. The thing is: the raise wasn't supposed to be tied to any performance review at all.This led to the point where the boss dropped the classic line: ""If you don't like it, you can always quit.""

On the r/Bridezillas subreddit, people constantly post about the biggest bridezillas in their lives, and ask for advice on how to handle delicate situations. This person's relationship with the bride has devolved so much that the OP doesn't even know if they should show up to the wedding at all. As the OP writes, first, the bride alienated a lot of family members by picking and choosing specific people from the family to come, even when that meant picking 2 people out of a 4-person family. Talk about awkward! Then, the bride chose a pricey venue located a few hours away, meaning a hotel or bed and breakfast is a must for the entire family.

Surprising, I know, but it gives me hope that some people do have the capability to be decent and rational.Well, this guy, Redditor u/Nerd_Law, is continuing to be haunted by his ex-wife, from who he split eight years ago. Not over children or hard feelings… but certainly over her finances. He keeps receiving phone calls from a debt collection agency that is trying to reach his ex-wife to recover her debts. These companies infamously have no boundaries and will call your best friend from first grade if it means that they have a shot of hitting a payday. He was absolutely fed up with this situation and decided that a little revenge was in order to balance the scales. Keep reading for this tale of revenge. For more,

171,"One of the most popular stereotypes about parents is that once someone has kids, something shifts in their brain that makes them feel like the most esoteric person alive. They smugly remark on how different the world looks now that they've got kids, implying that they've got something far more important in their lives than anything a childless person could be doing. Although I understand how annoying this can be for those of us on the receiving end of this smug, I kind of get it. I cannot imagine anything else that could radically change your priorities and viewpoints within such a rapid period of time. Having a tiny human to care for makes everything else feel like a B-Tier priority. ""There's drama in your adult recreational sports league? That's nice, I'm creating lives.""

Sure, you may have had your 'happily ever after' 2 weeks on your honeymoon, but once you get back from your 'just married' vacation - the dust begins to settle and life takes things into its own hands. Suddenly, it's not all rainbows and unicorns but bills, chores, and adult responsibilities. In the ebb of it all, it's important to not lose sight of your love and the connection the two of you have built. Sure, there will be obstacles along the way, but as long as you tackle them together, as a team, nothing will stand in your way.

182,"Motorcycles are dangerous, everybody knows that. In fact, that's the reason why so many people think it's hot to ride a motorcycle. There's something about the complete lack of self preservation, danger, and rebellion that we feel when looking at a guy on a bike. But there's a line that can be crossed when it's no longer cool and rebellious to be on a bike and it's simply dangerous, scary, and reckless, especially when it comes to your teenager. One Redditor, a motorcyclist and part-time bad boy, recently learned the hard way what happens when you cross that line, potentially ruining his relationship and setting up a teenaged girl for a lifetime of biker guy fetishes. The man recently posted on AITA, wondering if he was being a jerk to his girlfriend (whom he was about to move in with). She had asked him to pick up her 14 year old daughter after school and he happily obliged, not specifying that he would be picking her up on his motorcycle. OOF.The man was excited about a potential bonding moment with the teenaged girl, considering they were just about to move into his house, and he took it upon himself to load her up onto his motorcycle without the mom's explicit permission, going on a nice little joyride in the mountains before returning home. When the girlfriend found out later that evening, she was absolutely livid that her teenager was on the back of the motorcycle, scorching the Earth where the man stood for endangering her daughter. Shocked, the man wondered if he might have screwed things up with his girlfriend and, in Reddit's opinion, he certainly screwed the pooch on this one.

Now, if we asked you to name the most dangerous kind of cat, you'd probably think about cougars or lions or tigers, but you would be wrong. No, the most dangerous kind of cat - by far - is the tiny adorable itty bitty kitten. How? Simple. Kittens have power over humans like no other cat has. All it takes for their power to affect us is for us to look at a kitten's tiny ears or at a kitten's adorable triangle tail, and we're done. That's it.

As a society, we place so much importance on having a significant other that many of us will ignore the red flags when we see them.This is even more relevant when we fall on hard times. Crappy stuff happens all the time in life, and often it's the people around us who bear the burden of how we feel about it. At least, that seems to be the case with u/Inevitable-Trip3538. Originally planning to attend a high end work event with her partner and stepsister, her plans changed after her boyfriend had a diagnosis at the doctor. After spending hours consoling her partner about his newfound anemia, he decided he didn't want to go to the event. She then attended it with her stepsister, who had really wanted to go. He was none too happy about this, but the people of Reddit were skeptical of his reasons to be upset. It's not like she had completely abandoned him.

Plants require meticulous tending and care in order to thrive in your home– like a pet. In the old days, you could just set your dog free on the ranch and hope it came back without any broken limbs.

And as the OP shared in this post to r/TalesFromtheFrontDesk, at their hotel, people can only use the pool for an hour at a time, and it closes at 10 P.M. sharp, so that the OP can complete the rest of their front desk duties.

198,"As the saying goes, no one knows how to push your buttons better than your family. When you're raised together or spend lots of time together, you soon realize just what makes people tick. In this family, there's a silent war going on between the OP and her half-sister, who always tries to one-up her at everything — even her own engagement party. The OP shared this infuriating tale to r/pettyrevenge, but in my humble opinion, this is pro-level revenge. After announcing a party to celebrate her engagement, the OP got a tip from her cousin. Her half-sister was planning on wearing a stunning gold and white dress to OP's engagement party. It literally does look like a wedding dress, and a very fancy and expensive one at that! The OP included a photo to prove just how unhinged this half-sister's idea really was. If you know the first thing about weddings in many countries, it's so simple — don't wear a dress that's fancier than the bride's! Some people just can't help it. They need to be the center of attention at all times. That's a shame for the OP, who did share an update after the fact. It's not the best update, but hopefully they'll be happier with their new family arrangement. Scroll down to check out the story below. Then, swim into the deep end with these watery memes about fish and sharks.
