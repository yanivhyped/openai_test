What Is 'Tubgirl' And Why Should You Not Google It?
","One thing we've learned about the internet is that when you tell someone to not Google something, chances are they're going to Google it. TikTok recently learned this the hard way when the shock site ""Tubgirl"" became mainstream again. If you're not familiar with either TikTok or Tubgirl, good for you. Chances are though, if you're here, you're trying to find the NSFW video that you've heard so much and so little about. No one wants to ruin the ""surprise"" for you. Luckily, we're here to explain to you what this gross viral video is and why you shouldn't look much further than this webpage. So, I guess, let's explain.  Back in the early days of the internet, before even YouTube was around, there was a website called Rotten.com that was known for exactly what it advertised. On December 12th, 2000, the website posted a header for an upcoming video picturing a Japanese woman lying down in a bathtub. Ultimately, the image was likened to pulpless orange juice, as if she was drinking that in the bathtub. Of course, the ""orange juice"" was not orange juice which, of course, led to shock and awe when gazed upon. As major social media sites started popping up in the mid-2000s, Tubgirl reared its ugly head. In 2005, it was added to Urban Dictionary, a website known for its ""Don't Google"" challenges such as the Alabama Hot Pocket or Rainbow Kisses (be careful). In 2007, the Tubgirl image was accidentally added to the front page of the gaming website Kotaku. From this, more mainstream awareness surfaced, highlighted in many early YouTube reaction videos.  As most people know, TikTok hasn't been around for as long as most of these sites. Inherently, the young audiences on TikTok only found out about Tubgirl last year. In fact, in March 2021, Google searches for Tubgirl spiked four times higher than in 2016 when PewDiePie watched the horror and filmed his reaction. Roughly a year later, in August 2022, TikTok rediscovered Tubgirl. The reactions have been consistently gut-wrenching over the decades.

What Does Women ‚òï Mean? Coffee Emoji Meme Explained
","Out of all clich√© comments that we saw become viral in 2022, none became as ubiquitous while remaining as cryptic as ""Women ‚òï."" While the meaning of the catchphrase is not that difficult to decipher (laughing at women, duh), the way it came to be still remains a mystery to many. If you're willing to explore the origins of ""Women ‚òï"" and learn about its counterpart ""Men üç∫,"" stick with us for this explainer.  Women ‚òï is a reference to a scene from a popular Team Fortress 2 animated video by YouTuber Tipsy Duck. At the start of the video, two men (Team Fortress 2 characters Medic and Soldier) are standing in a yard, coffee in their hands, as a woman (Scout's Mom) walks by. Medic humphs and remarks, ""Women,"" with both men proceeding to laugh while taking sips from their cup and coffee pot.  In 2021, a clip from the video of just Medic and Soldier saying ""Women"" and laughing was uploaded to YouTube. It was that clip that in September 2022 gained popularity as a video reaction for clips of women acting cringy, irrational or in another chuckle-worthy manner. In late 2021, the format started spreading to TikTok, becoming a recognized meme on the app by February 2022.  And as the format became popular, it didn't take long for it to evolve into the notorious 'Women ‚òï' comment to be spammed on videos of women doing irrational or straight-up stupid things. ""Women ‚òï""  is a phrase that usually gets commented on videos of women doing things that can be perceived as stupid, irrational, stereotypical of women or inconsiderate ‚Äî not unlike commenting that the woman in the video is ""taking an L."" At the end of the day, ""Women ‚òï"" is just a snarkier, more conspicuous way of saying ""Woman Moment,"" another meme that has been used for the same purposes. But unlike Woman Moment, ""Women ‚òï"" has not (yet) been labeled misogynistic. The clip of Medic and Soldier laughing and sipping coffee has been used as a video reaction format, used to laugh at women doing stupid things. The ""Women ‚òï"" comment, which is a reference to the video, has been used for the same purposes, but in comments.  As ""Women ‚òï"" comment achieved widespread recognition, it has sometimes been shortened to simply ‚òï to convey the same idea. If you know, you know! A counterpart to Women ‚òï, Men üç∫ has also been appearing in comments on TikTok and other social media. Unlike the original, Men üç∫ is instead typically a positive comment used to celebrate massive and medium-sized Ws accomplished by males.

What's Going On In Ohio, And Why Is It A Meme? Let's Explain Ohio Memes
","At the center of America is Ohio, not only geographically, but culturally as well. It's like if Breezewood, Pennsylvania was an entire state, comprised of fast food, gas stations and skinwalkers galore. It's no wonder why meme creators on TikTok, Twitter and elsewhere keep saying, ""Only in Ohio"" within their content. The history of Ohio memes dates back much further than this most recent Can't Even X in Ohio trend, alluding to a stigma surrounding the Buckeye State that has been prevalent online since 2016 when Ohio vs. the world was a genuine threat. Don't remember that trend? Don't worry, it's always been Ohio‚Ä¶ Let's explain how the state became a meme and how it represents the modern absurdism in America.  The online fascination with Ohio can be traced back to one Tumblr post from 2016 that showed a broken bus stop reading, ""Ohio will be eliminated."" The visual went instantly viral because, well, the idea was so funny. It had so much wiggle room, like, what had Ohio done? Why did it have to be eliminated? Some gave their reasons. Others showed contempt, stating, ""it's for the best.""  The image circulated the interwebs from Reddit to Twitter to Instagram, accumulating more Ohio-based memes that satirically labeled it as a threat. In 2019, the epitome of those memes landed online, being an MS-Paint drawing of two astronauts: one fully aware of Ohio's global reign, and the other dangerously blind to this truth. This was the ""Wait, it's all Ohio? Always has been"" meme template, and it's trended in memes going into the 2020s. Even if the ""two astronauts"" format has become irrelevant, the stigma it created surrounding Ohio has stuck around to the present day.  As TikTok became the largest meme platform in 2022, Ohio memes followed the hype train. But of course, a new Ohio-based trend had to emerge and that was Only in Ohio. TikTokers started sharing creepypasta footage, showing giant creatures attacking cities and satirically proclaiming that an event of such magnitude could only happen in Ohio. Then, TikTokers discovered Lil B, the based God's obsession with Ohio. His 2011 song ""Swag Like Ohio"" became the primary TikTok sound for all the videos.  Inspired by the Can't have shit in Detroit trend that labeled Michigan's metropolis as a lawless place of old, ""Can't even X in Ohio"" toyed with a similar catchphrase, however, it instead pulled on the creepy aspect of Ohio's aura. The trend imagines what it'd be like to take a nap in Ohio or eat a meal in Ohio or see a movie in Ohio. Any scenario done in Ohio leads to an obtuse outcome akin to how the state represents the American absurd in pop culture today.  Again, the creepy undertone of Ohio's memetic perception is evident in all of the Ohio trends' signifiers. What really goes on there? The memes ask the viewer. What really goes on in the place that represents America's epitome of capitalist, wasteland culture? The memes romanticize it. They want to represent the sublime of Ohio by folding at any further explanation of its aura. Instead, the meme creator turns to the creepy video or image, letting the viewer do all of the heavy lifting and be humorously scared of Ohio's dark powers, which ultimately represent the dark powers of America's culture.

What Is The Meaning Of 'Lightskin Stare?' The TikTok Meme Explained
","Lightskins vs. darkskins is a meme trope as old as, well‚Ä¶ As old as Vine. For some reason, Black creators on that app started a stereotype about the effeminate ways in which lightskinned men do anything. This includes the lightskin stare, which is incredibly zesty but also has unspoken rizz, portrayed in multiple TikTok memes that are trending right now. ""Lightskin stare"" memes are popping up all over TikTok that label cartoon characters, video game characters and movie characters as having charismatic prowess of the ironic nature. Like, why does Megamind have that gaze when he's supposed to have no b*****s? Still confused about what the ""lightskin stare"" is and where it came from? Let's explain.  A ""lightskin stare"" can be characterized by piercing eyes, furrowed eyebrows and pursed lips, similar to the Chad face but with a more soulful, seductive tinge. Think of the faces of Kumala and Savesta or that type of face Drake makes when he wants 21 Savage. Basically, the ""Lightskin Stare"" is a face one makes when they want to woo someone in a flirtatious manner. If one's ""Lightskin Face"" is romantic enough, the intended recipient will gladly oblige to a further obligation. Now that you know what the stare looks like, you might be wondering why it's specifically ""lightskin."" The answer delves deeper into meme history than you might think, dating all the way back to 2013 Vines. If you were online at that time, you might remember a Viner named Melvin Gregg who pretty much started the lightskin stereotype. Being a lightskinned Black man himself, Gregg painted himself as an effeminate weirdo alongside another Black Viner, King Bach. These stereotypes that they fostered led to more Vines and tweets about the concept, such as one video from Viner BuddyBillz posted in March 2014 that was titled ""Do the light skin face."" It's the first known meme to reference the now-notorious stare.  Many creators on TikTok are currently unearthing ""lightskin stares"" that they're finding in mass media like video games, TV shows and movies. When they see a new ""lightskin stare"" while watching something, they're quick to screen-record it and post it to TikTok, setting it to a slowed remix of the song ""Sin City"" by Chrishan. This audio and visual combination added on top of the pre-existing concept of unspoken rizz has led to a viral clich√© that's proving to be easy to replicate.

What Does 'Edgar Haircut' Mean?
","As far as haircuts go, the Edgar Cut is probably not the worst one. From mullets to afros and now the more modern Zoomer Perm, the ""Edgar"" fits right into the mix as the latest hairstyle slang prominent in memes. Maybe you've seen the TikToks or heard about when they were almost banned in a Texas high school? No matter what prompted you, it's led you here and now you know that the ""Edgar"" is essentially a bowl cut with a high-fade, popular among Latino men in the 2020s. But why is the ""Edgar"" called the ""Edgar"" and where did it come from? Here's a quick breakdown.  Before it was called the Edgar, the hairstyle was popular among South American men under a different name, the ""Takuache Haircut,"" which actually dates back to ancient Mayans. In drawings from that time period, many men are sporting the Takuache, which translates in Spanish to ""possum."" In early 2019 though, on February 9th, 2019, to be exact, a Puerto Rican barber named @anthonybarberpr on Instagram was featured on the account @mlbpuertorico, seen etching the hall of fame MLB player Edgar Martinez into the back of a young boy's head. From then on out, the hairstyle became associated with the video as well as the baseball player's namesake.  Once the aforementioned Instagram video dropped, the Edgar haircut started to receive meme attention on platforms like Twitter. The stereotype of the Latino boy who sports the Edgar became the defining image that was exploited by creators. With most of the jokesters being of Latin origin themselves, they rallied around the term going into the 2020s. An Edgar was, in this comedic lense, a boy who chased girls, wore True Religion and was a little mischievous and trendy. Trendy in the sense that many Latino boys started to sport the Edgar, whereby late 2021, so many Latino high school boys had the haircut that a Texas school even tried to ban them. Of course, it was an ironic petition created by the large, Latinx student body of the school, but it still got press coverage regardless. Since this spike in notoriety, it became a staple stereotype on TikTok, where many users referenced themselves as Edgars, being self-effacing.  By asking your barber for it‚Ä¶ Duh. It's actually not a terrible look. But if you do get it, be reminded that you might become one with the meme. You could post Edgar content, toying with the clich√© that already exists; that being a young, Latino boy who plays soccer, chases Latina girls, wears ripped, tapered jeans and goofs off in class. In the end, exploiting the Edgar reference in online humor isn't offensive if the intent is right. Besides, the people poking fun at Edgars, it seems, are the Edgars themselves.

What Does 'Hello There' Mean? Everything You Need To Know About Obi-Wan Kenobi's Iconic Meme
","The year is 2005. George W. Bush is President and ""Hollaback Girl"" is at the top of the charts. You're watching a Star Wars prequel movie, and Obi-Wan Kenobi, Ewan McGregor, jumps into frame and says ""Hello there"" to General Grievous, who replies in a funny voice, ""General Kenobi!"" Fast-forward to 2022 ‚Äî you're on TikTok or watching the Kenobi TV series and you see that moment again 17 years later, resuscitated by the death-defying witchcraft that is internet humor. It's clear Gen Z is having a lot of fun reenacting that scene, but you don't know where the entire reference begins. Here's a quick history and explanation of everything you could ever want to know about this storied prequel meme.  ""Hello, there"" is a line said in Star Wars: Episode III ‚Äî Revenge of the Sith by the character Obi-Wan Kenobi (portrayed by Ewan McGregor). In the scene, Kenobi surprises the film's antagonists by jumping down from a ceiling vent and saying the catchphrase. The film's main antagonist, General Grievous, then replies bemusedly ""General Kenobi"" as weapons are drawn by guards and Kenobi crouches into a fighting position. Two years later, on August 21st, 2007, YouTuber Thereisnospoon303 posted a rather horrifying remix of the scene with the title ""OBI-WAN SAYS HELLO WHILE I PLAY UNFITTING MUSIC."" The post received more than 8,000 views in 12 years. Over the next few years, Hello There became a frequent trope in prequel memes. Fans of the often-derided second Star Wars trilogy are one of the most active and committed meme communities on Reddit, congregating around the subreddit /r/PrequelMemes. The meme's standard and consistent use on /r/PrequelMemes brought it into broader notoriety, with a variety of remixes, riffs and repetitions of the phrase worming their way into public awareness.  In late 2019, TikTokers then began reenacting the scene live with one person portraying Kenobi and two people ‚Äì one standing behind the other to create a four-armed creature ‚Äì portraying General Grievous. In these TikToks, the humor and meme seems to center on the villain of the film rather than on Kenobi like the /r/PrequelMemes versions of the meme did. The TikToks became increasingly abstract after user @chuggernuts originated the format, with the four-arm antagonist toting odd items as weapons.  ""Hello there"" has become an iconic catchphrase frequently used when surprising somebody. It is also something of a litmus test for fans of the prequel memes and Star Wars memes in general. People really ""in the know"" (that is, true Star Wars fans) will typically reply ""General Kenobi!"" when somebody says ""Hello there"" to them.  It's actually a reference to the first film in the series when Obi-wan greets R2-D2 with the same phrase. GeNeRaL KeNoBi!!!!!!! This is an excerpt from the screenplay: Obi-Wan Kenobi: Hello there.
General Grievous: General Kenobi. You are a bold one. Kill him!
General Grievous: Back away! I will deal with this Jedi slime myself.
Obi-Wan Kenobi: Your move.
General Grievous: You fool. I've been trained in your Jedi arts by Count Dooku.
General Grievous: Attack, Kenobi!   For the full history of ""Hello There,"" be sure to check out our entry on the meme here for even more information.",https://knowyourmeme.com/editorials/guides/what-does-hello-there-mean-everything-you-need-to-know-about-obi-wan-kenobis-iconic-meme

Where Did The Photo Of The 'Wise Mystical Tree' Come From And What Does It Mean?
","If you are a millennial having grown up on the internet, you may remember a bizarre internet ad featuring this wise and mystical looking CGI tree giving advice to a knight, often alongside a banner that read, ""if you are over 25 and own a computer, this game is a must-have!"" Or you may be a confused zoomer seeing an inexplicable influx of ""you gotta be a wise old tree if you think we f*ckin"" content. Here's the lore behind how this random anthropomorphic tree became the huge meme it is now.  Historical documents say that the Wise Mystical Tree first emerged from ancient Roman scrolls that depicted ‚Äî  just kidding. The photo of the 'Wise Mystical Tree' comes from a series of internet click-bait ads from the mobile game company Plarium for the purpose of advertising their browser game Stormfall: Age of War around the year 2017. These ads were noted to be hilarious from the get-go, with people on Tumblr, 4Chan and Reddit noting the absurdity of the image.  The tree and his message continued to gain steam, and some thought it reached critical mass when someone discovered new artwork of the tree looking deep into your soul. The photos of the tree were remixed in a variety of ways, and wise old tree memes about the sexual nature of banner ads as well as various styles of video games grew popular.  But tree lore never dies, and after a lull in the image's usage between 2017 and 2022, it made a comeback in the form of absurd Zoomer humor on Twitter and TikTok. The wise mystical tree is one of those memes that relies on the inherent absurdity of an image for comedic effect, making it versatile in its uses. You don't need all the meme lore to know that this tree is f*cked up bruh. Moreover, the rise of the tree's popularity on TikTok among audiences that definitely were not over 25 and in possession of a computer in 2017, means that weird, surreal and contextless humor is alive and well. Here are some ways you can use the wise old tree meme, both as an ode to the meme's roots and its new Zoomer humor patrons.

What Is A 'Sleeper Build?' The TikTok Term Explained
","Within so-called ""GymTok"" circles on TikTok, bodybuilding heads are currently obsessed with a new, ideal body type called the ""sleeper build."" Although the term's been used prior to the weightlifting community picking it up, sleeper builds and their aesthetic are akin to anime protagonists, seemingly unachievable by a mere mortal. So then, who are these kids on TikTok with baby faces and massive arms flexing their ""sleeper builds"" on camera for likes? Are they just SARMs Goblins or are their builds ""natty?"" Let's explain.  A ""sleeper build"" is a weightlifting and bodybuilding slang term that means looking weak, skinny or physically inexperienced yet being jacked, strong and muscular upon further examination or after the flexing of one's bicep. Therefore, having a sleeper build is a matter of curated surprise, as in, people with sleeper builds wear baggy or unassuming clothing that conceals their build, only to roll up their sleeves and showcase what they've got.  As stated, the phrase ""sleeper build"" was not always a bodybuilding term. In fact, the term was originally used in the PC builder community. A PC with a sleeper build means a computer that looks like it's from the 80s or 90s but has the computing capability of a modern system. Also, the term ""sleeper build"" was used in car communities, as in a car that has a vintage body but the engine and interior of a modern sportscar. It wasn't until August 2022 that the term ""sleeper build"" became a trending topic on GymTok. The physique all stems from one Russian TikToker named @saifiev who started posting surveillance, VHS-style videos showing himself flexing his surprisingly large biceps in an elevator. Following his virality, many dubbed him the ""sleeper build,"" starting the trend that soon encompassed many TikTokers.  Now that you know what it is, of course you want to get a ""sleeper build"" yourself. Imagine the social prowess it would lead to. You could provoke anyone, leading to a fight, and they'd never know you're packing until the crucial moment. There are a lot of tutorials on achieving a sleeper build. According to TikToker @theajbaron, it's about three things: 1. Getting your a** in the gym
2. Drinking a lot of protein shakes
3. And eating a lot of pasta (to burn calories) According to him as well, the skinnier you are at the start, the easier it is to achieve the sleeper build. Therefore, it seems to all be in the arm workouts and leaving the rest (besides maybe abs) to the wayside.

What Does 'City Boy' Mean? The Slang Term And Meme Explained
","Ever since Hot Girl Summer was proposed back in 2019, men have been looking for a type of summer they can call their own. Before White Boy Summer, one of the most notable attempts was City Boy Summer, a fairly toxic response to Hot Girl Summer that imagines a season where men act cold and mean-spirited to the women in their lives. Now, the slang term City Boy is taking on its own life, particularly on TikTok, as a celebration of toxic masculinity. Here's a full explainer.  In May 2019, Doja Cat inspired an outpouring of memes about summer 2019 being a ""hot girl summer,"" a season where women celebrate female solidarity and looking good. A month later, men started to meme about a male-centric version of hot girl summer, ""city boy summer.""  Rather than focus on empowerment and solidarity, city boy summer inspired a lot of memes about treating women poorly or dismissively, including lots of jokes about cheating on your partner and pushing women aside in pursuit of a good time. The city boy summer memes became more and more scarce until June 2022 when TikTokers brought it back without the ""summer"" part. They started using ""city boy"" on its own as slang, essentially used to define a man who doesn't let women get in the way of a good time or success. An Urban Dictionary user popularly defined city boy as, ""A male who is living his very best life and chasing the bag at all times without letting Hot Girls or any female get in the way.""  In 2022, TikTokers have taken to using city boy as a way to call out and often celebrate videos of men acting toxic, dismissive and poorly to women. This includes everything from videos of a dude at the gym telling a woman ""f*** no"" when she asks for his Snapchat name to men proudly admitting to cheating on their girlfriends. Reaction memes celebrating the men are attached to the ends of the videos, including a scene from Gravity Falls where Deputy Durland yells, ""City Boy! City Boy!"" at the top of his lungs. These videos became notably popular in June 2022 with the hashtags ""#cityboy"" and '#cityboys"" gaining over 220 million and 300 million total views respectively.  One of the most popular reaction videos in TikTok's city boy videos is a scene from Gravity Falls season one episode three, titled ""Headhunters."" In the scene, Deputy Durland mocks the idea of Dipper, a literal city boy, being able to solve a crime, yelling, ""city boy! City boy!"" at him. The scene has been reinterpreted as a reference to the slang term in these videos rather than literally meaning a boy from the city.

Who Is The Female Cop In Memes? Officer Maegan Hall's Sex Scandal Explained
","Over the weekend, one scandalous story out of La Vergne, Tennessee captivated internet users who discovered that female cop Maegan Hall had been fired for allegedly engaging in sexual acts with eight of her fellow police officers. Although the police department's internal investigation started in December, it wasn't until January 2023 that social media got word of it and pasted the girl cop's face into memes across Reddit, Twitter, Instagram and elsewhere. The controversy snowballed as many likened her husband to a cuckold and laughed about the case's other details, including her alleged praise of the large members attached to her coworkers and a ""girls gone wild"" hot tub party that purportedly happened at a sergeant's house. Still confused as to why Maegan Hall the female cop is all over your timeline? Are you curious about all the hilarious details in the growing story? Let's explain.  On December 12th, 2022, the La Vergne, Tennessee police department received a complaint from Mayor Jason Cole which was documented in an official police document released by the department about what was titled a ""sexual misconduct investigation."" What the internal investigators eventually discovered was shocking. According to the initial police report, eight male officers at the department (Patrol officer Juan Lugo-Perez, Sgt. Henry Ty McGowan, Sgt. Lewis Powell, detective Seneca Shields, patrol and K-9 Officer Larry Holladay, Patrol Officer Patrick Magliocco and Patrol Officer Gavin Schoeberl) had engaged in sexual activities with Hall. Some of the stranger details levied in the police report include oral sex, hotel rooms, sex on a boat, a ""Girls Gone Wild"" hot tub party and Hall allegedly bragging about Sgt. Lewis Powell's ""big black d**k.""  On December 29th, 2022, the La Vergne, Tennessee police department announced that Maegan Hall's position had been terminated, meaning that the internal investigation found her guilty. As for the rest of the eight male officers, five of them were also terminated (patrol officer Juan Lugo-Perez, Sgt. Henry Ty McGowan, Sgt. Lewis Powell and detective Seneca Shields)  and three of them were only suspended (Patrol and K-9 Officer Larry Holladay, Patrol Officer Patrick Magliocco and Patrol Officer Gavin Schoeberl). Well, because of the strange nature of the scandal and its details, tabloids like the New York Post and the Daily Mail UK picked up on it. And of course, the local news station, NewsChannel5 Nashville was the first to report on it. Thereafter, memes surfaced across social media that mostly used one photo of officer Hall sitting down and smiling at the camera. Without proper context, her face was getting shared in many memes, inspiring interest as to who she was and what she did.  During her so-called ""sexcapades,"" Maegan Hall had a husband named Jedidiah Hall, a Tennessee state park ranger. According to the police report, Hall claimed that she and her husband were in an ""open relationship"" which ultimately allowed polyamory. However, also according to the police report, Mr. Hall was unaware of his and his wife's ""open"" status. Regardless, he stated that he was going to stick by his wife in a later statement. Once this crucial detail emerged via an article from the Daily Mail UK, many online believed his devotion to his wife made him a cuck.  Another crucial detail in the initial police report was that Maegan Hall had allegedly shared explicit videos and photos with her co-workers. The exchange was also mutual, meaning the male officers sent some back. Although a rumor started brewing that an explicit video of Hall had been leaked, no traces of it have actually surfaced.

Who Is The 'Serbian Dancing Lady' And Is She Real Explained 
","A creepypasta-like legend is going around social media right now that says if you see a Serbian lady dancing in the street at night, you should run. The Serbian Dancing Lady is scaring everyone from TikTok to YouTube right now, four years after she was first reported. But is there any truth to the reports? Here's what you need to know.  In 2019, Serbian news site Serbia Today reported on a scary viral video spreading around social media. The video, allegedly taken in Belgrade, Serbia, shows a woman in a dress dancing in the streets at night. The article claims that she chases anyone she encounters with a knife. It also shares a message from social media expressing fear that she might hurt a pregnant woman or child. They also uploaded a video of the alleged woman to YouTube, which doesn't show her chasing anyone with a knife, but does show a woman dancing creepily in the street at night. There is very little extra information about the Serbian dancing lady, with seemingly no other reports or sightings of her from around the same time.  Since the initial report in 2019, the story has spread across social media as somewhat of an urban legend. There has been no other solid evidence that she exists, leading some to believe the original video was just a creepy hoax or a prank. As far as we know, there are no reports that she's attacked or killed anyone. Despite this, there have been several viral videos uploaded online over the past few years allegedly showing her. These are likely hoax videos and tributes to the story, which has captured the imagination of many online since going viral. The videos have become increasingly popular on TikTok, some gaining millions of views and helping bring the legend from Serbia to the rest of the world.

Who Is 'Jamal?' The TikTok Meme Explained
","For the past couple of weeks, TikTok has been obsessed with a young Black boy named Jamal. His smile is contagious, as he appears at the end of many photo slideshows and memes on the app that humorously frame him for many illegal offenses that were obviously committed by someone else. Interest in Jamal has peaked online this week as TikTokers levy whether or not they believe that ""Jamal did it"" or ""Jamal is innocent."" And he's not alone, characters of many nationalities are entering the meta, like Stanis≈Çaw Krzysztof Wojciechowski, who may have helped Lil Yachty sneak the wock into Poland. For those who are confused, or don't even know how to watch a TikTok ""Photo Swipe,"" let's explain.  Basically, back in April of this year, a TikTok surfaced that used a bunch of emojis to pose a scenario in which a bunch of chicken from KFC had been stolen. There were four suspects and the final culprit present was an innocent baby with a racially insensitive name. He was satirically inferred to be the criminal, despite another emoji character holding chicken and claiming that he stole it. Flash forward to late 2022, the racially insensitive baby name has been changed to ""Jamal"" and the picture used to represent the character has become an image of child actor Abraham Clinkscales. Add all of these factors on top of the song that the TikToks use, which is You Gotta Move by Mississippi Fred McDowell, and you get a trending meme that uses racial stereotypes for (hopefully) satirical usage.  Photo slideshows on TikTok have become a highly-used feature, so much so that the trends they start are generating cross-platform interest. ""Jamal Did It"" is one of these trends with most of the content being ""photo swipes"" and not videos. Therefore, the image of Jamal is usually the last one to appear in the final photo of the slideshow, all happening over Mississippi Fred McDowell's song with the progression surprisingly suiting the rhythm of the beat.  At its core, ""Jamal Did It"" is fueled by racial stereotypes. When the ""who stole it?"" question revolves around a specific ethnicity, the final culprit is always an egregiously potent stereotype of the culture in question. So, yes, it's kind of racist. Even though the trend is kind of parodying racism, by creating an imagined character who is so racist that they'd target innocent Jamal for every, mundane crime, the meme is still pretty racist.

Who Is 'Kid Named Finger?' The 'Breaking Bad' Mikeposting Trend Explained
","Why are people suddenly calling Mike Ermantraut from Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul ""kid named finger?"" How did Mikeposting become a thing? What do poor-quality anime memes have to do with all of this? Find all the answers for the latest ironic Breaking Bad trend in our explainer on the Kid Named Finger meme here. Before we explain why the character Mike Ehrmantraut, portrayed by actor Jonathan Banks, is being called a ""kid named finger,"" we have to explain two earlier memes that led to this. First, in late September 2020, a misinterpretation meme based around the snowclone ""Kid Named X"" gained popularity. The trend involved intentionally misinterpreting a word in idioms said by a teacher as a student's name, with an image showing that student's reaction. It's much easier to show than to explain, so see examples below for how it works.  Fast forward to March 2022 ‚Äî a trend known as ""Mikeposting"" gains popularity in the ironic Breaking Bad memes subreddit /r/okbuddychicanery. The trend involves taking terrible anime memes, usually image captions, and replacing the image with Mike Ehrmantraut (or sometimes other characters) from Breaking Bad.  Ten days after the Mikeposting meme started, Redditor Monday965 combined the two memes in an ironic amalgamation, making a post that got 3,800 upvotes in the subreddit.  From that post, a trend of calling Mike a ""kid named finger"" or simply ""finger"" grew, allowing for a great variety of memes ranging from ironic captions to terrifying photoshops.  Making Kid Named Finger memes are easy, but you really want to make sure your audience will be in on the joke ‚Ä¶ unless you want to confuse people, which totally works too. The first step is calling Mike ""kid named finger"" or ""finger"" and not providing any additional context. You really want to use some meme format that already exists and replace the original punchline with Mike. That's it, you're ready to shitpost!

What's The 'Girl With Trout' Video, Also Known As 'Using A Trout For Clout?'
","As far as shock videos go, ""Using a Trout for Clout"" may sound pretty tame. But this video, allegedly from Australia's Tasmania, shows a lady with a trout in a place where a fish should not be, ever. It's also being called ""1 girl 1 trout."" On top of that, the man and woman also allegedly defiled a cemetery's gravestone of a beloved artist. Yikes, it sure sounds like it was an eventful day. What more is there to know about this terrible ""trout video"" that's being shared on Reddit and Twitter?  Yesterday, a video surfaced on Twitter of a woman on a fishing boat. The camera then panned down to the woman's more private region where a fish was located. Long story short, the fish was not supposed to be there, likely forced in by the woman's male accomplice. After a trimmed version of the video was shared on Twitter, a full-length and explicit version was shared on Reddit's /r/Unexpected subreddit. It was quickly removed by the subreddit's moderators and the Redditor who shared it was immediately banned. Regardless, that Redditor was the one who titled the post, ""Using a Trout for Clout.""  After the video surfaced on Twitter and Reddit, Australian news outlets Mercury and News.com.au published articles about a couple allegedly located in Tasmania who'd filmed two explicit videos that had surfaced online. The first video was the infamous ""trout video."" The other was allegedly of the same couple, showing them getting freaky on top of the grave of deceased artist David Hammond Chapman.

Who Is 'Nathaniel B?' The TikTok Trend Explained
","In the span of just a couple of days, the humorous name turned meme trend on TikTok shifted from Quandale Dingle to a new memetic character known as Nathaniel B. After the hilariously bad rap freestyle surfaced this month, creators could not hold back their speculation. Who is Nathaniel B? Where did Nathaniel B come from? Why did the roaster choose that terrible bar for his roastee in the first place? Let's explain.  On July 31st, 2020, a TikToker named @oscar_dozzz posted a video that was ""Part 5"" of a six video series, all from the same ""roast battle"" that happened between members of his high school football team. In the video, a taller upper-classman is facing off against a smaller underclassman. It's this underclassman that levied the notorious bar. With the crowd seemingly on his side at the start, he rapped, ""That shit was trash. You can't handle me. Hold up, ain't you Nathaniel B?"" Of course, these bars were deemed ""trash"" and his teammates immediately started to laugh and jeer. One can be heard asking, ""What he say?"" while the rest shouted, ""Get the fuck outta here!"" After two years, the video received roughly 2.7 million plays and 397,000 likes, with most of its engagement occurring in early August 2020. Sadly, in August 2022, @oscar_dozzz was banned on TikTok. His alt account still exists, but the original Nathaniel B video has since been deleted. Luckily, reposts were made during its 2022 resurgence.  Although the original video was uploaded two years ago, it hasn't trended as a meme until this month. This is primarily due to a viral repost that was uploaded to TikTok on July 6th by TikToker @kindfellow3. The repost made the video pixelated and moldy with text overlay reading, ""Who tf nathaniel b???"" After this repost went viral, earning roughly 2.3 million plays in one month, many TikTokers latched onto the concept of ""Nathaniel B,"" mostly due to the absurdity of the name placed in the context of the video. TikTokers ironically speculated as to who Nathaniel B was, surfacing random Facebook users with the same name or tagging the Nathaniel B. Palmer research ship owned by Offshore Service Vessels LLC.  After the video went viral again in 2022, the freestyler who uttered the ""Nathaniel B"" bar revealed himself in a TikTok Duet. His name was PRINCE MAJ (@princemaj3), an 18-year-old from Tennessee. He soon explained his rationale behind the bar in a follow-up video. He relayed that he was a freshman going up against an upper-classman and was nervous to join the battle. However, he was ushered in because, at the time, he was a known SoundCloud rapper at the school. According to him, Nathaniel was the name of the upper-classman's younger brother and he added ""B"" just to rhyme, being an abbreviation of the word ""Bro.""

What Is 'The Belly Press Thing' On TikTok?
","One of TikTok users' favorite things to do is post videos that reference something in as vague a way as possible, almost forcing viewers to do their own deep dive to learn more. Lots of the time, the things they're referring to are sexual in nature, like the knee thing or why the tip of the penis is mushroom shaped. The belly press thing is no different and refers to a sexual technique that can help stimulate a partner's g-spot more intensely. Here's a full rundown.  ""The belly press thing"" has been going around online since the early 2010s. An article by Men's Health from 2010 calls it the ""sandwich trick"" and Glamour magazine shared the technique in 2016, claiming it was taught as part of a ""squirting workshop."" In January 2022, TikToker @yourpalric posted a thirsty video writing, ""When she asks why I'm pressing down on her stomach"" that gained over 6 million views, referring directly to the technique in as sly a way as possible. Videos referring to the technique kept on spreading over the course of the year, eventually becoming colloquially known as ""the belly press thing"" for lack of a better name. So what is the belly press thing? Essentially, it's a sexual technique where one partner presses down on a woman's stomach just above the pubic bone during sex. According to Sexologist Carol Queen, who spoke with Glamour in 2016, this pushes on the woman's bladder, which is right above the g-spot. Pressing above the pubic bone pushes the g-spot, which can effectively stimulate it from the outside. When done during sex, it pushes the g-spot closer to the penis, making it easier to hit and resulting in a more intense orgasm.  On TikTok, users spread the word of the belly press thing through vague videos referencing it by ""the belly press thing,"" avoiding describing it in any detail. While some TikTokers have taken the time to describe it in great detail, such as doctors, most of the videos consist of women asking how a man they're with knows the technique in the first place, suggesting it means they have a long sexual history. Other videos by male creators have them thirst-trapping and bragging about knowing the technique as if it puts them a few notches higher on the sex-having ladder. It doesn't, but it's nice to see that both men and women can get in on the trend.

Who Is 'Dreamybull?' The 'Ambatukam' Meme Explained
","Across TikTok, iFunny and 4chan (you know, the three depths of the internet) a handsome Black man named Dreamybull has grown a rather odd fandom. He's had the help of his alter-ego too: a man known as Ambatukam Omaygot. Recontextualized versions of Dreamy's explicit videos have made their way into memes, predominantly making use of his so-called ""O-face."" It's a very memeable expression, and so are his loud noises in which he exclaims, ""Oh my God!"" There's a lot to unpack about this person. Who is Dreamybull? What's his real name? And how did this meme start? Let's explain.  Dreamybull's real name is Perrell Laquarius Brown and he lives in North Carolina where he has a wife and two kids. He was born in 1992, making him 30 years old as of 2022. Brown is a self-proclaimed ""Advocate for Straight Men Extreme An*l Play."" Therefore, he makes a lot of his income from his private website and subscriptions for his explicit and erotic content. Brown's Twitter account specifically is filled with images and videos that are only for mature audiences. In fact, his social media presence is isolated to Twitter. Dreamybull wasn't always the subject of memes. For a long time, he was just doing his thing, making a decent income and supporting his family. In early 2021, however, specifically Indonesian TikTokers started using his Twitter videos in their comedic TikTok content. The first known video was uploaded in February 2021 but has sadly been deleted since. Clips of Dreamy reaching climax in a car or at home were cropped in these videos so as to not show anything gross. Him flamboyantly screaming, ""I'm 'bout to c*m! Oh my God!"" were then imagined to be the name ""Ambatukam Omaygot"" which is pronounced the same way when being read like a first and last name.

What Does 'Grip Reaper' Mean? The Slang Term And Meme Explained
","Within comment sections across TikTok and Instagram, a new slang term has emerged used to describe e-girls. It's called a ""grip reaper."" It's most often spammed beneath a video, usually of a young woman who is super quirked up in an almost nauseating way. Her quirkiness is a signifier, to some men, of a hidden trait of hers that is the ""grippiest."" In essence, the nickname ""grip reaper"" is a way to describe how ""tight"" a woman is. This might be obvious to some who know what ""grip"" means and have a certain foreknowledge of its effects. However, the tricky part to understanding this meme and slang term is, what does being quirky have to do with it? How does quirkiness affect one's grip? This meme dates back a few viral videos ago, when one woman from Chicago started it all. Let's explain.  As stated, the term ""grip reaper"" started because of one video and one woman. In fact, many already know of her due to an entirely different meme. Her name is Chloe Woodward and she's known online as ChloeLMAO. Chloe first went viral on Vine in the early days of the app's existence for a video known as ""Who Is She?""  Flash forward to the 2020s and Chloe looks a lot different. She has bleach blonde hair, a liberal arts degree and an OnlyFans, effectively making her an ex-Vine star. She still maintained a following on Instagram and Twitter going into her 20s and one time, she uploaded a video while sitting in a Chicago park.  Her original Instagram video was reposted by many meme accounts, eventually landing on TikTok in 2022. A TikToker named @bruhwastakenwastaken reposted the video and earned millions of views as well as thousands of comments. One of the comments read, ""dis da chicago grip reaperüíÄ.""  Something about Chole's rapid delivery that tinged on the most schizo of internet-pilled shawties gave off the impression of a ""grip like glue"" to these male commenters. This gut feeling from the men that alludes to a mass perception of ""art girls"" everywhere was then mixed with the concept of the ""Chicago Grim Reaper,"" which was an actual nickname given to drill rapper Lil Reese.  Since the comment section of that one TikTok video, the comment sections of any mildly ditsy girl are filled with ""grip reaper"" and its many variants. At the end of the day, the nickname is both creepily invasive, oddly flattering and deeply embedded in meme history.

What's With The 'Zoolander' Memes And What's The 'Zoolander Song' On TikTok?
","The comedy movie Zoolander has resurfaced in a big way online. Multiple Zoolander memes have surfaced on TikTok and elsewhere, ranging from the notorious Zoolander stare to Owen Wilson saying, ""Excuse me brah"" to Ben Stiller. Back in the day, Zoolander was a successful comedy movie and inspired many memes before the year 2022. However, now its main character is being compared to other sigma male icons, effectively pinning Derek Zoolander against others like Patrick Bateman and Ryan Gosling as to who is the greatest literally me guy of all time. All of the Zoolander edits and memes are generating mass engagement, with many wondering how they started, what scenes they use and what songs they use. Let's explain.  The Zoolander stare is the first Zoolander meme that blew up this year and ultimately plays on the lightskin stare meme that labeled lightskinned Black men as having God-level unspoken rizz. It started with one TikTok uploaded on November 28th and used a clip from the movie's opening scene when Ben Stiller's character Derek Zoolander sees Owen Wilson's character Hansel on the red carpet. Additionally, the song used in the ""Zoolander stare"" meme is a mashup of the songs ""Who Is She?"" by I Monster and ""The Perfect Girl"" by Mareux.  After the virality of the ""Zoolander Stare"" meme, another trend emerged using a different scene from the red carpet. It showed Owen Wilson's character Hansel arriving at the red carpet while riding a scooter. Hansel then stylishly puts away his scooter and gets photographed by a hoard of paparazzi. The meme was dubbed Hansel Getting Photographed and the first video that used the format was uploaded on December 7th.  After two movie scenes were exploited, of course, meme creators had to dig up every Zoolander scene for content thereafter. This practice led to the ""excuse me brah"" trend that used a scene where Zoolander and Hansel bump into each other at a nightclub and exchange some comebacks. Once the first video meme using the scene was uploaded to TikTok on December 13th, many creators started object-labeling, lip-dubbing and generally reenacting the scene.  In both the Hansel getting photographed meme and the excuse me brah meme, TikTokers stuck to using one song called ""Party Party"" by yally and Waq1ux which has the primary lyrics, ""If you see us in the club we'll be acting real nice.""

Why Is Everyone Talking About A Redditor Having Sex To 'Cbat' By Hudson Mohawke? The Meme Explained
","Almost everyone's been guilty of sharing too much information before, but sharing too much information between friends and sharing too much information online is a totally different ballpark. If you share too much online, you run the risk of going viral and never living it down, becoming an eternal footnote in meme history. There's perhaps been no better example of that this year than the story of one Reddit guy's weird sex music, aka ""Cbat,"" which has quickly become one of the biggest memes in the world, inspiring even the song's producer to comment on it. Here's how. On September 1st, Redditor TylerLife hopped on /r/TIFU (Today I Fucked Up) to share a story that literally nobody asked him to share. The post, titled, ""My (20F) girlfriend of two years told me the music that I (25M) play during sex is weird and a major turn off,"" sees the Redditor explain how he's been having sex with his girlfriend for two years to a playlist that includes the song ""Cbat"" by Hudson Mohawke. He even calls it his favorite song to have sex to, saying it plays almost every time they get busy and that it sets him to the ""perfect rhythm for doing the deed."" One day, out of the blue, his girlfriend told him that the song was a turn-off ""in a major way."" The Redditor took the song off his playlist but admitted that sex ""feels awkward now"" and that he still thrusts to the tune of the song, even in silence. For those who aren't aware of the song, he provided a link at the bottom of the post. Hearing the song firsthand is what really set the internet off. The post gained over 130,000 upvotes and was shared on every social media platform out there, becoming a viral sensation within days.  Since TylerLife shared the story, people from all corners of the web have come together to laugh at the poor Redditor and react to the story. One of the main sources of memes is TikTok, where users are posting videos humping the floor to try and match the beat of the song, essentially putting themselves in the shoes of the Redditor. Others are just expressing shock over the story, wondering how someone could possibly think ""Cbat"" makes a good song.  TylerLife actually posted his full sex playlist, titled ""Lovetime,"" to YouTube a few days after the post went viral. It includes songs like ""Love In This Club"" by Usher, ""Angel"" by Shaggy and ""I don't wanna do this anymore"" by XXXTENTACION, to name a few. On September 4th, TylerLife made a follow-up post to /r/tifu where he explained how he was ""overwhelmed"" by the response and didn't expect the story to get so big. He also claimed his girlfriend's sister found the post and connected the dots. She shared it with her parents, things got awkward, and now he and his girlfriend are broken up.

What Is The 'Siren Gaze,' 'Siren Eyes' And 'Dark Femininity?'
","Everyone's familiar with questionable, male pick-up culture, but many don't know about the female equivalent, also known as Dark Femininity. Alpha Males and their more under-spoken counterparts Sigma Males are social aficionados, ready to swoop in like Chads to every Stacy in the room. However, women can do the same, using their Siren Gaze and Siren Eyes to seduce any man. On TikTok and Twitter, these Girlboss tactics are being highlighted and emphasized more and more by women who want power over men. But what do these terms mean? How does one mimic a ""Siren"" and its eyes? Trust us, you don't need to watch Euphoria to find the answer. Let's explain.  Siren eyes refer, first and foremost, to the Greek mythological creature, the Siren, being a dangerous, feminine creature that lures nearby sailors and ships with enchanting music and singing, similar to a mermaid. The most notable siren in pop culture is no doubt the Starbucks logo. In the 2010s on social media platforms and internet blogs, makeup tutorials popularised the concept of ""Siren Eyes."" The style featured heavy eye makeup meant to draw attention to them, subsequently luring men into the trap. The beauty trend spread to TikTok tutorials and ultimately led to an aesthetic comparison between ""Does Eyes"" and ""Siren Eyes."" These two terms were based on makeup lingo but were also embedded in physical expression.  The term ""Siren Gaze"" was first referenced in TikToks in early 2022. Users posted about practicing their ""Siren Gaze"" just in time for Hot Girl Summer. An account with the handle @secretsofasiren was one of the first to popularize the term. It posted videos that showed ""tips"" for attracting men using the ""Siren Gaze."" In one video, the account posted what might be the most accurate depiction of the ""Siren Gaze"" (if it does indeed exist). The video featured Euphoria star Maddy Perez who became a primary example for what to strive for. Superimposed on her face in the video are the specific physical motions that are said to prove irresistible to any man, including; ""Raise your eyebrows and narrow your eyes"" and ""open your mouth slightly to mimic an expression of pleasure.""  Overall, ""Dark Femininity"" is the feminine practice of utilizing the ""Siren"" aesthetics to draw power out of men. One TikTok account called @darkfeminineguru is the primary source of this new wave of gender expression. They encourage manifestation, self-care, manipulation, being an empath, and above all else, ""Dark Femme Summer."" Some celebrity women are used as examples for this account including Marilyn Monroe, Megan Fox, Julia Fox, and again, Maddy Perez.

Why You Should Never Look Up 'Lara Croft Death' In GIF Search

But why exactly are users being discouraged from making this risky search? Well, we did the searching so you don't have to and here are our results.  Earlier today, Twitter user @ShitpostGate posted a ""Peter Running"" meme captioned, ""Never look up Lara Croft death in GIF search and select the 2nd result, worst mistake of my life,"" without any further explanation. The meme quickly gained over 23,000 likes and 1,200 retweets as users inevitably refused to follow the meme's advice. But what does the search actually yield? Well, if you type ""Lara Croft death"" into the Tenor GIF keyboard, used on apps like Discord, you'll find a number of GIFS of Tomb Raider's protagonist dying. But the one referred to in the meme shows Croft getting killed by a horse. More specifically, it shows a horse's penis jutting out of her mouth, having impaled her from behind. The GIF was shared numerous times in the Twitter post's comment section, but all we can show you is the censored image below. You're welcome.  There's a surprising amount of 3D-rendered adult content about Lara Croft taking on animals. This means it's a little bit difficult to trace the exact origin of the GIF.

A video of a woman who resembles Breckie Hill in the shower is, in fact, really going around online. But is the video really of Hill, or is it just a Breckie Hill dupe? The short answer is that we don't know for sure, but Breckie has posted several videos referencing the shower video and responding to commenters asking about it. In her responses, Breckie never denies that the video is of her. In one of her first responses to the leak she asks her followers to never bring it up again. In another video she poses near a shower, which inspired a user to ask if that's ""the shower."" She responded with a video claiming it's not and asking her viewers to ""stop asking."" Some users have speculated that the shower video leak is a promotion by Hill for an upcoming OnlyFans account, but again, this is unconfirmed.

Who is 'Kevin Nguyen?' The Meme Character Explained
","We all know Karen, a white woman who has a ""Live, Laugh, Love"" sign in her living room and a grudge against service workers. She represents a type of person who, at some point, most people have encountered. Kevin Nguyen is also pretty well-known. He's an internet caricature of a certain kind of Asian dude, probably from the suburbs, who speaks with frat-like inflections and appropriated AAVE, puffs his vape and raves. He's a party guy, and he's a bit of a himbo. He's kinda politically incorrect, and he has an extremely common name. Still lost as to what this meme is all about? Allow us to break it down below.  The earliest reference to the Kevin Nguyen character came out of Twitter, when on October 31st, 2018, the user @oblyviann tweeted the fateful message.  The tweet gained over 45,700 likes and 10,300 retweets in a year. According to many, the meme was likely popularized in the Facebook group Subtle Asian Traits, which was created on September 16th, 2018. Subtle Asian Traits, which has around 2 million members, is a private Facebook group for Asians across the world to share memes about life, culture and general vibes. Kevin Nguyen is an extremely common name. In fact, according to a Vice article, it's the most common name on the Subtle Asian Traits Facebook group. To get an idea of who Kevin Nguyen is, there's no better place to begin than the Kevin Nguyen starter pack. Assembled here, you see some of his favorite items below. 
There's a JUUL, boba tea and wristbands from a rave.  For a physical description of Kevin Nguyen, try this tweet on for size ‚Ä¶ though it's worth noting this isn't the only type of Nguyen attire.  To learn more about his interests, there's a handy list below.  The character has inspired a lot of discourse, as many stereotypes do. Some, including this man who really is named Kevin Nguyen, believe the stereotype holds a deeper social and political resonance.  Often posters (frequently female, it seems) express distaste for Kevin Nguyen. Some have gone so far as to call him a ""disgrace to our people.""  6' 0"" ‚Ä¶ of course. Reportedly, over 40 percent of people in Vietnam use Nguyen as a last name. The name came to Vietnam with the Chinese, who conquered the territory in the medieval era. At the time, the Vietnamese did not use last names, so administrators assigned surnames for record-keeping purposes and Nguyen just happened to be one of those. As time went on and the Chinese left, a tradition of taking on the last name of whoever the ruler was then emerged. Since the last royal dynasty in Vietnam was the Nguyen Dynasty, naturally, many people took on that name.

What Is The 'Notti Bop' And Why Is It The Most Disrespectful Dance In New York?
","It seems like every day there's a new dance trend going viral on TikTok, but the latest viral dance trend, the ""Notti Bop,"" is a little bit different than the rest. Set to the song of the same name by Kyle Richh, TikTokers have been ""Notti Boppin'"" for the past month by rhythmically punching their hips along to the track, often with police officers, teachers and other authority figures. Little do many of these participants know, ""Notti Bop"" is a rather disrespectful diss track and the dance was created as an indirect way to mock the death of a young rapper. Here's what you need to know.  ""Notti Bop"" is a diss track by New York-based rapper Kyle Richh. He started teasing the song on TikTok earlier this month in videos where he dances along to it by punching his hips rhythmically as he raps ""Notti boppin', punching my hips."" The full song dropped on October 8th and it wasn't long before the dance spread across the platform, wracking the original sound for the song up to over 15,000 uses in around two weeks. Kyle Richh allegedly wrote ""Notti Bop"" as a diss track about 14-year-old drill rapper Notti Osama, who was stabbed to death at a subway station earlier this year. Allegedly, Osama got into a fight with a 15 year old rival, who was arrested. The full details on his death are unclear, but the drill rap scene is known for the violence that surrounds it, with young rappers regularly losing their lives due to gang-related activity. The dance is allegedly meant to mimick a stabbing motion, mocking the way Osama died.  Doing the Notti Bop dance, also known as ""Notti Boppin',"" is easy, if you still feel the need to do this after reading everything above. All you have to do is stand in one spot, then rhythmically and softly start alternating punching each hip with your fists as Richh sings, ""Notti boppin', punching my hips."" Some people follow the hip punching with a spin, although it's not necessary.  The Notti Bop is the most popular on TikTok, but it can also be found on YouTube and Twitter. In most of the videos, TikTokers are seen performing the dance with authority figures like police officers, principals and teachers. The idea seems to be to trick unsuspecting people into performing the dance on camera, essentially having them mock Notti Osama's death unknowingly. Doing the dance with an authority figure isn't necessary, as other videos simply have groups of friends performing the dance together. As the story behind the dance has spread online, discussion, memes and videos about the dance itself have also spread. Some people are calling it the most disrespectful dance in New York, while others are shaming people who do the dance.  ""Notti Bop"" starts with a sample of a song from The Backyardigans called ""Castaways"". Notably, ""Castaways"" went viral on TikTok last year, actually boosting it to the number one spot on Spotify's Viral 50 chart in May 2021.

Me As A Baby: Who Is This Whimsical Little Creature?
","You might have seen people online making videos dressed in white gowns and green pointy hats as they twirl around in their gardens. The general response from most people is to think, ""Wow, that looks just like me as a baby."" This joke is as inane as it is impossible for the unindoctrinated person to understand. Here's why people are obsessed with the tiny flying puppet known as Mestre Ensinador, or ""Master Teacher.""  The short answer is, Brazil! A TikTok account named MestreEnsinador1, which translates to ""Master Professor"" in Portuguese, has been posting videos of him playing with a puppet he calls his ""teacher."" The puppet is shown flying around the forest, doing his little dance, and even performing mysterious rituals.  MestreEnsinador's videos are entertaining enough by themselves, but the puppet's oddly humanlike movements sparked inspiration in one of his fans. TikToker @iz.khalifa decided to show her little brother one of the videos and try and convince him that the video was him as a baby. Her brother's visible confusion and eventual acceptance of the fact went viral, especially after he was duped with another video of him ""in Sedona.""  The white gown and pointed green hat are Mestre Ensinador's official costume, and people are dressing up as him to mimic his dancing and flying style. Moreover, the ""This Is You As A Baby"" prank has expanded beyond pranks on baby siblings, with various people showing the video to their parents and friends and asking them, ""Do you remember this? It's you in Sedona.""

What Is The 'Animan Studios' Meme? The 'Axel In Harlem' Video And Others Explained
","Recontextualizing adult media is a meme trend that isn't dying out anytime soon, evident in the latest meme amid the genre called Axel in Harlem. The adult cartoon showing a man walking with an over-sized rear end was made by Animan Studios, and for some meme enjoyers, it's becoming the new Ambatukam. Redraws, fan art and TikTok videos are all using the Animan Studios scene where Axel is getting stared down by three men on a sidewalk. The creativity is blossoming across Twitter and Facebook as this meme is becoming mainstream. It's not just ""Axel in Harlem"" that's getting memed. Another cartoon showing a cowboy is getting lit up too. Need to know more about where this meme came from, who Mr. Animan is and why it's such a big meme right now? Let's explain.  Mr. Animan is a man of mystery. According to a 2011 interview from the Seattle Gay Scene, Animan is a pseudonym and the artist refuses to give his legal name. This is because he fears that his ""animation gig"" would have repercussions on his job status. However, Mr. Animan did reveal in his interview that he's American but lives overseas. Granted, this interview is from 2011, so who knows where the elusive Mr. Animan is right now. One thing's for sure, though ‚Äî he's still active on Tumblr and Twitter, which is where he posts most of his explicit animations other than on his website.  As of right now, one Animan Studios animation sticks out from the rest, entitled ""Axel in Harlem."" It follows the story of a Black man named Axel who, according to Mr. Animan, is ""the neighborhood man-slut [who] attracts men like a magnet."" Of course, the now notorious cartoon shows Axel strutting down a Manhattan sidewalk as other men ogle at his behind. They follow him up an elevator to their final destination. The ""Axel in Harlem"" cartoon was first shared to Tumblr in April 2016.  Years later, in 2020, it spread to Twitter, finally landing on Facebook and TikTok in its most censored and memeable form.  ""Axel in Harlem"" is also well-known in Latin and South America. In fact, Spanish and Portuguese-speaking meme creators are pretty much the reason that Animan Studios is such a big meme right now. On Facebook and TikTok, they started sharing the opening sequence of the cartoon set to the Peruvian song ""La Cumbia de Free Fire"" by Bukano, specifically the lyrics ""V√°monos De Fiesta A Factory."" Thereafter, the song became associated with the meme. English-speaking TikTokers decided to choose a different song for Axel walking through Harlem, namely the song ""Ballin'"" by Mustard and Roddy Rich. Thereafter, the song became associated with the meme and both songs propelled the trend going forward. Other than ""Axel in Harlem,"" there's another animation of Animan's that's gaining meme attention, and it features a bunch of cowboys similar to Ram Ranch. The animation is titled ""The Sheriff of Lone Gulch"" and many are ironically calling it Red Dead Redemption despite no other correlation to the game than the wild, wild west. The biggest Animan Studios meme format outside of videos is redraws in which illustrators and artists are re-editng the screencaps of Axel walking and the three men staring. They're inserting different characters from many TV shows, movies, video games and more into the template.

Whether it's because of Yeat's influence or not, the Yodie Gang is definitely in Blinker City, hitting dabbingtons in Yodie Land, all in the footsteps of this goofy YouTuber and streamer. So who is Fulcrum? He's seemed to have appeared out of nowhere, getting more ""faded than a ho"" in Home Depots everywhere. Maybe you saw xQc react to him, or stumbled upon his TikTok fandom that's been making the rounds in people's ""For You"" pages. He's definitely very interesting, and worth diving into. Let's explain this trending streamer.  Damian Luck is an American YouTuber and livestreamer from Walnut Creek, California. He started uploading content to YouTube in late 2019 which was (you guessed it) drug-related. Fulcrum's consumption of zaza has always been potent, even showcased in his early strain reviews. Of course, however, everyone knows Damianluck925 for his habit of getting ""faded than a ho"" in random department stores, fast-food restaurants and other recognizable, branded locations. This habit (which later became his most notable form of content) started with a video he posted on April 28th, 2021, where he hit his blinker in Target.  Since he started his public livestreams last year, the dude has really grown a following which rapidly grew in the past month due to reposts of his clips to TikTok. Damianluck925 has some iconic catchphrases already like: 1. Fulcrum, come in! Yuhhhh, Yodie Gang!
2. Faded than a ho!
3. Need I say more? All of this Zoomer slang is blowing up on TikTok right now, creating a new language for a new fandom that's spreading fast. Soon enough, you're sure to hear one of these TikTok sounds on your feed.  As microinfluencers have started spreading Fulcrum's message, larger influencers have also taken notice. TwistyP was the first and now Twitch's xQc has joined the Yodie Gang. Even Andy Milonakis has joined in on the hype, tweeting out a Fulcrum catchphrase on Wednesday.

Why Is 'The Boys'' A-Train Breaking Up Happy Couples On TikTok?
","The latest season of Amazon Prime's superhero series The Boys recently wrapped up, and based on all the memes coming out of it, people loved it (well, except for maybe the finale). But one of the most recent The Boys memes to blow up is A-Train POV I See a Happy Couple, a TikTok-centric format that's based more on the show's first season than the third ‚Äî specifically the very first episode where the protagonist named Hughie watches as his girlfriend is turned into a red mist when A-Train accidentally kills her (more on that below). Basically, the meme is used to joke about extreme reactions to feelings of jealousy, but there's a lot more to it than that. Here's an explainer to break down the fine details of what this latest trend is all about ‚Ä¶ you could say, ""We're even now.""  The joke about A-Train seeing a happy couple stems from the opening scene of the first episode of The Boys. In the first scene of The Boys, the superhero A-Train, who has super speed, accidentally kills a woman (Robin Ward) by running straight through as she's embracing her boyfriend. The scene is extremely graphic, showing the woman burst into a puddle of blood as A-Train zips through her at super speed. The TikTok meme takes a fan cam edit of A-Train and adds footage of a happy couple before it, captioned, ""POV: I see a happy couple."" When A-Train pops up, most fans of The Boys will immediately make the association between A-Train killing Robin and the caption, implying that the poster is so jealous they want to kill the woman to split the couple up. Basically, ""if I can't have her nobody can,"" but in the most extreme (and ironic) way possible.  The meme is very simple: take a little bit of footage of a couple being visibly happy or showing intimacy, then slap some footage of A-Train looking cool over it. The trend was seemingly started by TikToker @awesomer.thing22 and has inspired hundreds of variations across TikTok at this point, all essentially bubbling down to the same thing. Oh, and don't forget the cool techno music. The meme became particularly popular on National Girlfriend Day on August 1st, a perfect time for all the single people to vent their anger through A-Train memes. It's pretty self-explanatory why the meme thrived on Girlfriend Day, and it helped the meme spread from TikTok to Twitter. Could this be the new seasonal meme for single people every Girlfriend Day? Only 2023 will tell.  Soldier Boy Singing ""Rapture"" By Blondie refers to a scene from The Boys where the superhero Soldier Boy sings ""Rapture"" by Blondie during a guest appearance on the 1980s television series Solid Gold. The clip gained viral spread over the following month, also becoming a prevalent original sound on TikTok used in comparison skits where the original version plays followed by Soldier Boy's version.  You're A Fucking Disappointment is a line of dialogue spoken by Soldier Boy in season three of The Boys.  A captioned screenshot and clip of the scene became a GIF and reaction image, as well as the subject of image macros, that month, typically used to express disappointment toward someone or something.

What Does It Mean To Be The 'Friend Group Leader?'
","Every strong group of people needs a leader to guide them. According to the internet, that logic applies to even the most informal of groups, including the humble friend group. Recently, memes about being the Friend Group Leader have spread from TikTok to Twitter to social media at large and the general idea behind them is sparking mixed reactions. In case you're lost on all of this, here's why.  The idea of friend groups having a leader comes from the idea that most professional groups, whether it's a political group or a workplace group, have a leader. Groups generally need one person to ""lead"" them to function and make sure everyone is on the same page. A good leader might help the other members stay on task, provide guidance to the group and find what each member is good at and delegate appropriate work to them to generally help the group thrive and achieve their goal in a given setting. While friend groups or cliques are (ideally) much more organic and not exactly working towards any goal, it's funny to imagine these groups having a leader. What's more, some friend groups might naturally develop a perceived leader. Maybe it's the most confident or outspoken member of the group; maybe it's the person whose house everyone goes to for poker night or the one who always seems to have the best plans. In some cases, it might be the most manipulative and headstrong person in the group ‚Äî think Regina George in Mean Girls. The first known popular meme to mention the idea of a friend group leader was posted by TikToker @danessyauguste in March 2021 and imagines a conversation between a member of the group and the friend group leader, where the friend group leader gaslights them, portraying friend group leaders as stereotypically toxic. This negative connotation has carried through to many future memes on the topic.  Memes about being the friend group leader are most often found on Twitter and TikTok. On Twitter, you're likely to find posts joking about what it means to be the leader of the friend group, either portraying it as something toxic, portraying the leader themselves as toxic, or, in contrast, placing them on a high pedestal. On TikTok, users tend to make skits about the friend group leader, either playing the role of the leader or a lower-tier member of the group. Again, many of the skits focus on the ""toxic leader"" who is overtaken by the small amount of perceived power they've been given over their peers, such as a skit by TikToker @mw.luchi where the leader reminds his friend to kiss his feet when he enters the room. Of course, most of these are ironic and overblown for the sake of comedy; remember, if your friend group leader is a tyrant, they may not be a good leader at all.  There is not always a clear leader of the friend group. Some people refute the idea of a friend group leader altogether, such as Twitter user @TheColtonShow__, who writes, ""if your friend group has a leader, that might not be a friend group."" TikToker @codenamejesse posted a video discussing the topic where he says there's ""no leader in a group of guys,"" except in certain situations, where various members momentarily become the leader. He gives a few examples, saying the friend who's good at basketball is the leader when they're playing the sport while the friend who's best at gaming is the leader when they're gaming together. In the end, the ""leader"" of the friend group is something that everyone perceives differently. Some groups may have a more clear-cut leader, while others may not.

Why Are TikTokers Saying 'I Am Jose Mourinho?' The Meme Explained
","It seems that nowadays, you can't open TikTok without someone saying they're ""Jos√© Mourinho."" The sound has been proliferating in popular videos for months in skits where people make ridiculous captions and mouth along to the words ""I am Jos√© Mourinho."" This can be pretty bewildering if you're one of the people in the world who does not know who Jos√© Mourinho is. Luckily, we have the explainer to give you the rundown on who Jos√© Mourinho is and how he became a TikTok audio star. With this information, we hope that we can help you decide whether you too want to be Jos√© Mourinho. Let's begin. Jos√© Mourinho is a Portuguese football (or 'soccer,' if you're a Yank) manager who is currently the coach of Italian Serie A club Roma. Since starting his managerial career in 2000, Mourinho earned a reputation as one of Europe's best managers, leading high-profile clubs including Chelsea, Inter Milan and Real Madrid to sterling seasons. He also very openly has a high opinion of himself and is well known to talk about himself basically as if he's God's gift to football. However, while Mourinho undoubtedly has a high opinion of himself, he also has a self-aware sense of humor about it, which brings us to the next section. In early April 2022, Mourinho appeared in an ad for Topps stickers in which he sent up his egotistical reputation. In the ad, he begins by saying ""I am Jos√© Mourinho"" before running through his list of accomplishments. He then declares he will coach ""all"" the teams in the Euro 2024 tournament before the apparent director of the commercial corrects him and says he can merely collect stickers for all the players in the Euro 2024 tournament. Beginning in late April 2022, TikTokers began taking the clip of Jos√© Mourinho introducing himself and pairing it with sketches in which they concoct a simple scheme, like putting one's head to a radiator to fake a temperature and get out of going to school. Many of the edits contained jokes about utilizing subtle tricks to get desired outcomes in romantic relationships, like getting the girl or scaring off a boy. The sound reached the peak of its popularity in the middle of May, so it may be ill-advised to attempt to go viral with it now, though, in the past, there have been TikTok sounds that have come and gone in waves. Who knows? Perhaps you can be the next Jos√© Mourinho ‚Äî or at least the reason his audio trends again.

What Are These 'Little Miss' Memes About?
","The virality of the Little Miss meme template has been palpable this month. Creator after creator is re-editing the classic children's books, and it's showing how nostalgic both the Little Miss and Mr. Men series are for Gen Z. It's not hard to explain where these memes came from and who started them. It's even easier to explain how to make them yourself. However, let's just say you've never even read a Little Miss book. Let's just say you're childhood was ruined. You can still create ""Little Miss Ruined Childhood"" and feel like you're a part of the trend! So c'mon, let's explain.  Little Miss memes, also known as ""Little Miss Parodies,"" refer to the exploiting and recaptioning of the covers of Little Miss children's books. If you've never heard of these children's books, they began publication in 1981, written by British author Roger Hargreaves. However, as Zoomers grew older, the adjectives used to describe the Little Misses became dated. Therefore, the replacement of the adjectives in Little Miss memes highlights a new generation finding modern predicaments and red flags in themselves then mirroring them back onto a nostalgic, highly remixable meme template. Mr. Men memes involve the same type of recaptioning and re-editing, however, they exploit the male side of the book series titled Mr. Men. In contrast to the Little Misses books, the Mr. Men series started 10 years prior in the year 1971, still written by Roger Hargreaves. As of 2022, there are 92 different Mr. Men and Little Misses characters.  The first ever Little Miss meme was shared on Tumblr in June 2021 by the blog notyourgaybestie. It depicted ""Little Miss Smokes Too Much Weed,"" and to many, it rang true. In fact, it rang so true that it earned a lot of cross-platform reposts that'd later accumulate into the 2022 trend.  Despite a 2021 origin, many liken the popularity of Little Miss memes to an Instagram user named @juulpuppy who uploaded three carousel posts in mid-April 2022 that included most of Little Miss memes popular today.  Oh, so you want to make a Little Miss meme now? That's easy. All you need is Photoshop or MS Paint and a black line tool. Then, once you've outlined a silly character, use the paint bucket tool to fill in the colors you want.

Who Is 'Rap Battle MrBeast?' The Fake MrBeast Meme Explained
","MrBeast is the biggest YouTuber in the world right now, which makes his face pretty iconic. However, in memes as of late, a knock-off MrBeast has become more prominent. The meme sparks the question of who would win in a rap battle: the real MrBeast or Rap Battle MrBeast? Across YouTube, Twitter and TikTok, this bootleg MrBeast is making the rounds in exploitable video templates. Of course, he seems to be from an Epic Rap Battles Of History episode, but that's not entirely true. Curious about who is this MrBeast is and why he's all over your timeline? Let's explain.  In November 2021, around the time that Squid Game was popping off, a YouTube channel called Freshy Kanal posted a ""rap battle"" video between Seong Gi-hun and MrBeast. The video was inherently in the style of Epic Rap Battles Of History, which was a childhood YouTube staple for many Gen Z kids. Of course, something was off about this knock-off Epic Rap Battles Of History, specifically the MrBeast guy. For your information, the man's name whose playing MrBeast is YouTuber Skitzy.  Similarly to how Barack Obama's Epic Rap Battle was parodied, the MrBeast rap battle became a trending YouTube Poop as video creators remixed and exploited MrBeast's introduction. The first exploitation happened on January 17th, 2022, when YouTuber miiwii2 posted a YouTube poop music video (YTPMV) that replaced the video's audio with the Undertale song ""Fallen Down"" by Toby Fox.

What Does 'My Brother In Christ' Mean?
","Do you have friends you talk to online? Do you casually scroll through Twitter or some other social media looking at all the conversations that take place and see the arguments happen in real-time? If so, then you've probably come across the phrase ""My Brother In Christ"" at some point in the past month and a half. While seemingly being religious in nature, the expression itself actually has no real link to Christianity and is more of a slang term like Oh My God. If you're still not too sure about it, we've got your back with this handy explainer on the phrase.  ""My Brother In Christ"" was originally used as a replacement for the ""N-word"" in memes that began around 2019, with the earliest use being in a remix of a Dudes Be Like 'Subway Sucks' meme, replacing part of the punchline to say ""My Brother In Christ,"" which has been used on and off in Christian meme circles for many years. The first instance of My Brother In Christ being used to replace the N-word came on February 18th, 2022, as a post on Twitter by user @etherxeno.  My Brother In Christ was quickly picked up and used in memes after it was first posted in early 2022. Originally, it was kept to its introductory meaning, which was as a replacement for the N-word in specific meme cases where it was known to be used. Eventually, however, the phrase became a common vernacular that was used as a replacement for any sort of way to refer to someone, meaning it could replace words such as ""friend,"" ""enemy,"" ""stranger"" or anything else when talking to someone. This is also when the meme began to be remixed slightly with different words being used that turned it into ""My X In Christ"" as a phrasal template.  My Brother In Christ is a way to refer to someone online and does not have a positive or negative connotation to it. It can be used in a positive, negative or neutral manner when referring to friends, family, strangers or enemies.  In the book Colossians, which is a literal letter sent to the city of Colossae, the greeting written by Paul is ""faithful brothers and sisters in Christ,"" which is where modern religious greetings, and eventually the meme, get the wording from.

On May 31st, 2022, TikToker @leahhwoodss posted a video in which she and her friends passed time on a long car ride by playing a game where one person would present a hypothetical scenario such as, ""He's a 6, but drives a nice truck. What does that make him?"" The next person would answer how the ""nice truck"" affected the hypothetical person's attractiveness, and pose a similar hypothetical to the next person. The game spread on TikTok over the following weeks before hitting Twitter roughly in mid-June 2022. There, the game aspect was lost as people racked up likes and retweets by posting their versions of the hypothetical person, only without the challenge to the reader to rate the person with a significant attribute. From there, the rest is (short) history. The central premise of the meme is to give a hypothetical person of some level of attractiveness a quality that will either positively or negatively affect their attractiveness level. Often this takes the shape of ""S/he's a 10 but‚Ä¶"" followed by a playful negative attribute, usually intended to be humorous. While many very mildly clever iterations of the meme have gone viral, the format has spawned a wave of haters, as many feel it is not a particularly humorous or worthwhile meme. This has led to a situation where some of the broadest iterations of the format veer towards being, for lack of a better term, cheugy, meaning popular but very basic. If you want to post your own ""She's a 10, but"" meme, understand the market is extremely saturated at the moment, and if you want to stand out, you'll have to come up with an extremely solid punchline.

What Is 'Meatspin?' The Viral Shock Site Explained
","There are a lot of shock sites out there but few are as well known as Meatspin. The website features a very closely zoomed looping video of two males in the throes of a passionate act, positioned just right so that one of the men's pieces of ""meat"" starts ""spinning"" and it became a massive phenomenon when it first exploded onto the internet in 2005. Here's everything you need (but don't necessarily want) to know about the infamous Meatspin site.  The Meatspin video allegedly comes from an adult film titled TSBitches and was first used online in 2004 on a YTMND page. The page showed multiple clips of the video on a loop set to ""Ridin Spinnaz"" by Three 6 Mafia. In 2005, possibly inspired by the YTMND page, a single serving site called Meatspin went online showing the same video set to ""You Spin Me Round"", quickly becoming an online phenomenon. The website's domain name was actually sold on eBay in February 2006 for $2,100 US. A month later, the first-ever reaction video about the website was uploaded to YouTube. From there on, the website continued to spread online and through word-of-mouth.  The majority of content surrounding Meatspin is reaction videos where people film their reactions or others' reactions to watching the video. There are dozens of Meatspin reactions on YouTube dating all the way back to 2006, some showing people laughing, some crying and some just straight-up bewildered. There are also numerous memes about Meatspin, including lots of memes trying to bait people into searching ""Meatspin"" or visiting the direct URL. The video is even still getting attention on TikTok, where users are often telling each other to not Google it and relying on reverse psychology to do the rest.  In 2006, the popularity of Meatspin inspired a viral parody animation called Leekspin where an anime girl, Orihime from Bleach, spins a leek to the song ""Ievan Polkka."" It's a much more wholesome alternative to Meatspin that's gained its own massive virality over the years and should be celebrated for simply not being Meatspin.  In March 2013, a Florida State University student named Benjamin Blouin managed to hack into his school's wireless network. With all that power in his hands, he decided to redirect every active user to Meatspin, causing what we can only speculate was the loudest collective gasp in recorded history. Blouin was arrested for the hack on a third-degree felony charge.

What's The Big Deal About This Viral 'Family Guy' Clip, And Why Is Lois Griffin So Horrified?
","The latest episode of Family Guy has the internet in stitches over a scene where Lois scream's Peter's name at the top of her lungs in her signature ""PEETAAAHH"" way. Whether it's on TikTok or Twitter, the video has been making the rounds with very little context, leaving many wondering, ""Why is she screaming like that?"" Here's what you need to know. The scene where Lois screams Peter's name comes from the October 16th, 2022 episode of Family Guy titled ""The Munchurian Candidate."" In the episode, Lois reveals to her girlfriends that Peter is hesitant to perform oral sex on her. Peter is put under hypnosis during a hypnotherapy session and given a trigger word that makes him perform oral sex on her, however, the trigger word gets mixed up. When Peter hears the theme to the show Extra, which goes, ""extra, extra,"" it triggers the prompt, making him go down on Lois. Things go wrong when Peter and Lois visit Lois' parents' house. During dinner, Peter goes up to Lois' mother Babs' room to deliver her a plate, as she is sick and bedridden. While he's up there, Extra comes on the TV, triggering him and leading him to go down on Babs. Lois hears the song and rushes up to stop Peter. She swings open the door and screams his name for a few seconds straight, but it's too late. Since the episode aired, people have been sharing the clip on social media, particularly on Twitter, TikTok and YouTube, making it go viral. Some people are sharing their reactions to the clip alongside their posts, while others are remixing it by adding new sound effects and contexts. One Twitter user took the clip and edited the Team Fortress 2 Spy into the mix, making for a truly cursed clip. On TikTok, the audio clip itself has taken off as an original sound in similar reaction videos and as a lip dub sound. In these skits, people are reframing the scene from ""The Munchurian Candidate"" to fit around situations from their own life.

What Does 'Let Him Cook' Mean? The Phrase Explained
","Within TikTok comments, Twitter replies and Instagram posts, every meme creator has one thing to say: ""Let him cook."" Also known as ""Let that boy cook,"" this catchphrase is everywhere. Despite its high usage, many don't know where it actually came from. Did NFL quarterback Russell Wilson start the phrase, or did it just have the trajectory of most internet slang, as in, it started somewhere offline and then slowly seeped into the mainstream? There's an interesting history behind ""Let him cook,"" but first, we have to explain what it means.  The meaning of ""Let him cook"" is akin to giving someone the room to plot, strategize and hone their craft. Think about it like this: imagine that your friend is flirting with someone and another person is about to interrupt them. You'd have to hold back that person and say, ""Let him cook,"" inferring that your friend needs room to seal the deal.  It all started with internet rapper Lil' B, also known as The Based God. He posted a music video on YouTube back in 2010 called ""LIL B BASED COOKING (LET THAT BOY COOK)."" Thus, the catchphrase was born.  The phrase is predominantly used in an ironic sense, as in, the imagined situations where someone should be given room to ""cook"" usually won't have good outcomes. For instance, if someone has perceivably negative rizz in a video, one might say, ""Let that boy cook,"" or, ""Why did we let him cook?"" in the comment section and get thousands of likes.  The history of ""Let him cook"" as a meme can't be told without its influence on American football. A variant of the phrase surfaced about Denver Broncos quarterback Russell Westbrook, who has not played great in the 2022-23 season. Therefore, fans and critics of the Broncos have started saying ""Let Russ cook"" ironically, inferring that he stinks at ""cooking.""

What Are These 'Little Miss' Memes About?
","The virality of the Little Miss meme template has been palpable this month. Creator after creator is re-editing the classic children's books, and it's showing how nostalgic both the Little Miss and Mr. Men series are for Gen Z. It's not hard to explain where these memes came from and who started them. It's even easier to explain how to make them yourself. However, let's just say you've never even read a Little Miss book. Let's just say you're childhood was ruined. You can still create ""Little Miss Ruined Childhood"" and feel like you're a part of the trend! So c'mon, let's explain.  Little Miss memes, also known as ""Little Miss Parodies,"" refer to the exploiting and recaptioning of the covers of Little Miss children's books. If you've never heard of these children's books, they began publication in 1981, written by British author Roger Hargreaves. However, as Zoomers grew older, the adjectives used to describe the Little Misses became dated. Therefore, the replacement of the adjectives in Little Miss memes highlights a new generation finding modern predicaments and red flags in themselves then mirroring them back onto a nostalgic, highly remixable meme template. Mr. Men memes involve the same type of recaptioning and re-editing, however, they exploit the male side of the book series titled Mr. Men. In contrast to the Little Misses books, the Mr. Men series started 10 years prior in the year 1971, still written by Roger Hargreaves. As of 2022, there are 92 different Mr. Men and Little Misses characters.  The first ever Little Miss meme was shared on Tumblr in June 2021 by the blog notyourgaybestie. It depicted ""Little Miss Smokes Too Much Weed,"" and to many, it rang true. In fact, it rang so true that it earned a lot of cross-platform reposts that'd later accumulate into the 2022 trend.  Despite a 2021 origin, many liken the popularity of Little Miss memes to an Instagram user named @juulpuppy who uploaded three carousel posts in mid-April 2022 that included most of Little Miss memes popular today.  Oh, so you want to make a Little Miss meme now? That's easy. All you need is Photoshop or MS Paint and a black line tool. Then, once you've outlined a silly character, use the paint bucket tool to fill in the colors you want.

What Does 'Double It And Give It To The Next Person' Mean? The Viral TikTok Trend Explained
","TikTok channels that are dedicated to man-on-the-street type interviews have to come up with new questions all the time. One of the most recent tropes is called ""Double It And Give It To The Next Person,"" in which the person with the microphone offers a gift to a stranger who gets to choose between taking it or doubling it for the next person. It's sort of like a social experiment that tests the generosity of the stranger, as in, how much of an opportunist they are. The question often results in both wholesome and hilarious scenarios. But who started the trend, and how did it get so viral? Let's explain.  The first-known ""Double It And Give It To The Next Person"" video was posted on May 7th, 2022 by TikToker @johnrusanov. His original prompt was a little complex. He asked the strangers if they wanted $10 right then and there or if they wanted to give the eighth person he asked $20 instead. All of the seven people he initially approached wanted the eighth person to have it, leading to discourse about the indomitable human spirit. A few months later, on July 4th, 2022, TikToker @loganmillerx posted a similar video with a more simple plot: take five dollars or double it and give it to the next person. So although @johnrusanov's video started the concept, @loganmillerx made it easier to replicate going forward. At first, videos that used the concept were very straightforward. The interviewers usually just offered money, keeping it simple and hoping to get honest responses out of the strangers. However, as time went on, satire ensued and ironic parodies surfaced. These parodies started off by changing what was being doubled. For instance, people were presented with a hot dog (or glizzy) and asked if they wanted to take it or double it. Eventually, a chaotic number of glizzies were accepted by one hungry bystander. The same happened with milkshakes in a now-deleted video that body shamed the final woman for taking on four milkshakes on a hot day. As the ""Double it or give it to the next person?"" question became oversaturated on TikTok and YouTube, meta parodies started to surface that blended the video style with other oversaturated man-on-the-street interview questions such as ""What song are you listening to?"" and ""Can you record a video for me?"" Going into 2023, the phrase then took on a life of its own. For instance, TikTokers posed scenarios in which a doctor told them about their brain tumor. Instead of accepting the information, they say, ""Double it and give it to the next person.""

Why Is Miss Piggy Singing 'Cellophane' On TikTok? The 'Let Me Do It For You' Meme Explained
","TikTokers have fallen in love with the hit 2019 FKA Twigs song ""Cellophane,"" but it's probably not the version you're thinking of. Instead, they're bumping a cover of the song sung in the style of Miss Piggy that first started making the rounds early last year. Here's where the hilarious sound comes from and how TikTokers are using it.  In February 2022, a now-deleted Instagram user named  boyfriend__dick (now boyfriend.dick5) posted a screen recording of a conversation between themself and someone else. Specifically, they posted a voice note where boyfriend.dick5 sings ""Cellophane"" in the style of Miss Piggy. Although the original clip is deleted, the user reposted it to Twitter in December 2022, calling it one of their ""greatest accomplishments"" of the year. The ""Cellophane"" cover blew up on TikTok prior to the Twitter repost, first gaining steam on the platform in November 2022 when the original, acapella version was remixed with the instrumentation from the song. From there the original sound blew up, seeing over 87,000 uses by January 2023. The Miss Piggy version of ""Cellophane"" has inspired a lot of videos simply praising it for being hilarious and somehow very touching, with some even suggesting it surpasses the original. Many users are using the song as a backing track on videos of their adorable yet derpy dogs, with a huge focus on borzoi's, or as TikTok refers to them, the ""long nose dogs."" Some of the most popular examples show dogs looking sad while having a bath. The song has also inspired some remixes and edits on YouTube, like a version where FKA Twigs duets with Miss Piggy and a lo-fi hip hop remix. Basically, you can use this sound however you want, but if you have a borzoi you're going to have the most success.

Who Is Mogusa Shirose? 'Husbant, We Are Homeress' Meme Explained
","Memes featuring a young Asian woman standing in the snow, captioned with humorous monologues about how her husband spent too much money on his hobby and got them both homeless, took over Facebook and Twitter by storm recently. Many have since discovered that the woman in the memes is Mogusa Shirose, an independent Japanese singer. If you seek to find out more about the Husbant, We Are Homeress meme and Mogusa Shirose herself, look no further than our explainer below.  The first ""Husbant, We Are Homeress"" meme was shared by an anonymous 4chan user on October 26th, 2020, who posted a photograph of Japanese singer Mogusa Shirosa to /v/ board and paired it with a monologue in which she complains about her husband spending too much money on video games. The monologue is written in Engrish, which is a parody of the inaccurate use of the English language by Japanese natives.  The meme did not see further spread for almost two years. On June 11th, 2022, a 4chan user (likely the original poster) made the same post on the /v/ board, but this time it went viral. The meme format achieved virality after June 16th, when Twitter user @JackdawJackal posted a version of the meme about Bitcoin that went viral on Twitter and was reposted to other sites. From there on, the format in which the woman tells her ""husbant"" off for spending too much money and time on various hobby really took off, particularly on Twitter and Facebook.  Mogusa Shirose is a Japanese native who became popular on 4chan in 2018 as users discovered her social media profiles and shared her photographs simply due to finding her cute. Before the Husbant We Are Homeress meme went viral, photographs from Mogusa Shirose's social media profiles were posted on various 4chan boards, as well as on Tumblr, Twitter and other social media websites. Mogusa Shirose is an independent singer who previously posted her songs and music videos on SoundCloud and YouTube. She posted her first song to SoundCloud in March 2013.  While the phrase ""dies from hypothermia"" has been used as a part of the Husbant We Are Homeress meme format, it's only a joke made up for memes. Shirose is currently alive. Shirose posts her photographs and videos on her Instagram account @mog_beibu, where she has over 23,300 followers. She also has Twitter account @abgmgmp, although she has only made four posts since 2015. Unfortunately, both her Instagram and Twitter are currently set to private.  Shirose has also posted her music to her two SoundCloud accounts (she abandoned her old account and created a new one in January 2016), and to her YouTube account, although she hasn't shared any new songs since June 2018. The Husbant We Are Homeress meme format follows a rather simple structure that is easy to use in memes. If you want to make one using the format, consider making a pop culture reference and potentially editing the photograph or placing Mogusa Shirose in a certain setting that people will recognize.

Who Is 'Undertime Slopper' And Why Should You Love Them?
","The avant-garde of memes always trends towards the absurd and the surreal. Cutting edge content creators challenge audiences to expand their definition not only of what things can be ""funny,"" but what language, images, and sounds themselves can communicate. On TikTok, no account is quite as far ahead of the pack as Undertime Slopper. Whether you love it (as many fans declare they do) or hate it, you can't even begin to understand what's going on with it. But let's try our best to do exactly that. Undertime Slopper is a TikTok account that posts videos featuring 3-D augmented reality models with non-sensical and absurdist stories. Often, the TikToks are pretty short, most are not over thirty seconds long. Recently, each ends with the same video clip of a man with a Southern accent saying, ""I love Undertime Slopper.""  ""Undertime Slopper"" seems to be the name of the main character POV of the account, with recurring characters like various rocks, toads and random animals addressing the camera as ""Undertime."" It's unclear what the phrase means exactly, but the videos loosely describe the adventures of Undertime Slopper through a relatively normal-looking forest with wacky characters edited into it.  In the Undertime Slopper lore, the forest belongs to the all-powerful Albert, who seems to be negligent in doing his job of ""turning on"" different forest features such as streams and also seems to scare Undertime.  Undertime Slopper asks its viewers to contribute to the creation of new content by posting a clip of themselves saying ""I love Undertime Slopper."" Undertime Slopper then selects the best clips and edits them into TikToks. Undertime Slopper also has a series of accounts on other platforms. During the recent ""Battle for Undertime Castle,"" Undertime Slopper asked users to send in clips of themselves fighting an invisible enemy while saying the phrase, and then spliced them in to the battle as defenders battling a horde of menacing elves.  3-D augmented reality modeling is a technology which enables users to render holograms of 3-D objects onto a person's view of the real-world. Undertime Slopper uses this software to make it look like, for example, a trash can is parked in front of a Monet painting, when in real life there isn't anything there.  Undertime Slopper's videos are deeply surreal and leave a lot of room open for interpretation. Like many other TikTok memes, they also use an obviously artificial and technologically-conjured series of effects (in this case, 3-D AR modeling and automated robot voices). There seems to be a dynamic tension between the naturalness and drabness of Albert's Forest, where most of the TikToks take place, and the obviously synthetic 3-D images edited into the TikToks.  Undertime Slopper seems to represent the way that, even as we each walk around in our familiar and boring environment, our rich interior fantasy world illustrates what we see. A regular old park becomes a forest full of talking rocks and toads, and a regular day becomes a surrealist romp.

What's The 'Dancing, Walking, Rearranging Furniture' Meme? Why Is Family Guy's Carter Pewterschmidt All Over TikTok?
","Like any TikTok meme, Carter Pewterschmidt singing ""Dancing, Walking, Rearranging Furniture"" came completely out of left field and has totally saturated the ""For You"" pages of some meme enjoyers. The Family Guy character is of course singing a cover of Jamiroquai's ""Virtual Insanity,"" but why is it the biggest meme on TikTok right now? To fully understand where the Cartermiroquai meme came from, you gotta look back to YouTube and iFunny for the answer. It sounds daunting, but it's worth it for this ironic, nonsensical meme that makes Lois' dad an insane house husband.  On January 17th, 2016, season 14, episode 12 of Family Guy entitled ""Scammed Yankees"" aired on American television. On that fateful day, Carter Pewterschmidt was featured in a cut-away gag where he'd been left home alone. The gag was a parody of the famous music video for Jamiroquai's song ""Virtual Insanity."" In both videos, the furniture is moving, a bird is flying and they're going insane.  Before its usage on TikTok, the Family Guy scene was used in memes on YouTube and iFunny, predominantly starting in November 2021. Many credit iFunnyer @Radicunt as the true originator who also posted their videos to YouTube. Somehow, the meme got wrapped up with the SpongeBob 'All The Small Things' covers (don't bother asking why). In January 2023, TikTokers resurfaced the old iFunny trend for their own amusement. Initially, most of the memes simply captioned the video with text related to depression, loneliness and craziness. However, as time went on, the memes became more absurd, similar to the evolutions of """"Yeah I'd like to solve the puzzle"":https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/yeah-id-like-to-solve-the-puzzle, 'Chestnuts Roasting On An Open Fire' Guy or any other meme that gets exploited via CapCut templates.

What Does 'FNF' Mean?
","Across Twitter, TikTok and social media at large, people are using the acronym FNF. If you're a gamer, you might read ""FNF"" and think Friday Night Funkin', but this time you'd be wrong. This time, ""FNF"" stands for ""fuck nigga free,"" essentially meaning single as opposed to being with a bad boyfriend. Here's a full rundown of the term.  The exact origins of ""FNF"" is unclear, but it's been used in its relevant context since at least 2009 on Twitter. The term has been used as the title of several rap songs throughout the 2010s. It was most popularly defined on Urban Dictionary in 2017, defining it as, ""being single and happy with being on your own and making your own money."" Most recently, it's come into the limelight thanks to the release of the song ""FNF (Let's Go)"" by HitKidd and Glorilla, featuring lyrics about dumping a bad boyfriend and celebrating the single life. The song is going viral on TikTok right now as people call it a ""summer anthem.""  The acronym ""FNF"" is being used online, such as in tweets and TikTok comments, to celebrate being single and apart from bad boyfriends. It's also inspiring TikTok videos using the song ""FNF (Let's Go),"" many of which are about the same thing. If you've recently lost an unfaithful boyfriend and are enjoying the single life, you might want to get in on the trend.  Alternatively, some people online will use ""FNF"" as an acronym for the rhythm video game Friday Night Funkin'. Friday Night Funkin' is a battle rap game by Newgrounds veterans that became massively popular last year and still inspires constant fan art and content. Chances are, you'll see a lot more Friday Night Funkin' content than fuck nigga free content due to its massive fanvase, so always pay attention to the context of the FNF you're reading before assuming its definition.

What Is 'Ligma Johnson?' The Twitter Meme And Ligma Meaning Explained
","After Elon Musk acquired Twitter last month, interest has peaked once again over the slang word ""ligma"" due to two pranksters who fooled local news networks into thinking they were named Rahul Ligma and Daniel Johnson, two Twitter employees who had seemingly been laid off. Of course, they were faking it, staging the elaborate hoax and becoming meme legends in their own right. However, many people weren't in on the meaning of ""Ligma Johnson."" Addressing these people now, who are too innocent to understand: does the word ""ligma"" sound like anything familiar? How about the word ""Johnson?"" Are these two words a code for something, maybe, something explicit? Let's explain.  In almost everyone's online history, they've encountered the word ""ligma"" once or twice. Although the word seems like jibberish, it's a sneaky play on words meant to deceive the unknowing. Basically, ""ligma"" is an abbreviation for ""lick my,"" which entails the licking of an explicit male feature in the underwear region. Now that you know the dirty secret, where did the ""ligma"" joke come from? It all started on May 28th, 2018, when Twitter and Instagram user Galevik told Parkland shooting victim turned gun control activist David Hogg that he should ""boycott ligma"" in a Twitter reply. Hogg succumbed to the trolling and the exchange became a viral Instagram video after Galevik was blocked by Hogg.  So, if ""ligma"" means ""lick my,"" then what does ""Johnson"" mean? Well, the slang word ""johnson"" goes far back into history, well before the online era. Sometime in the mid-1900s, ""Johnson"" became synonymous with male genitalia. Some believe that it started in America after the popularization of automobiles. There's a part of a car called a ""johnson rod,"" and ""rod"" is also slang for a man's member. Therefore, ""ligma johnson"" is the combination of both slang words, essentially daring the person stating the ""name"" to lick their Johnson. Interest in ""ligma Johnson"" as a phrase peaked last month after Elon Musk bought Twitter and mass layoffs ensued following his arrival. News reporters, wanting to capitalize on the moment, flocked to Twitter's HQ in California. There, they saw two men holding boxes filled with stuff, presumably from an office cubicle. The two men claimed to be Twitter developers who were immediately fired after Musk's acquisition. They said their names were Rahul Ligma and Daniel Johnson. If only the news reporters interviewing them knew the meaning of the phrase‚Ä¶but they didn't, and were instead trolled in a crazy way.  Here at Know Your Meme, our editors reached out to the men behind the prank to ask them about their viral idea and its preparation. The prankster named Rahul Ligma is actually Twitter user @0interestrates, and he said: Both Ligma and Johnson were welcomed back to Twitter HQ by Elon Musk in mid-November, leading to a viral photo of the trio posing in front of the big bird logo.  Throughout meme history there have been multiple wordplays that bait-and-switch people in group chats, Twitter replies and Discord servers across the web. For instance, one of the first was Deez Nuts, in which the word ""deez"" was used to bait. Of course, ""deez"" went viral after a video from 2015 showing Instagram user WelvenDaGreat on the phone with his friend.  Even before ""Deez Nuts"" surfaced, the infamous word ""Updog"" had been tricking middle schoolers since the 1990s. It's unknown who first used the ""updog"" bait as a prank, but online instances of its use date back to the year 2000.  After the virality of ""ligma"" in 2018, multiple variants emerged like Sugma (""suck my""), Bofa (""both of""), Sugondese (""suck on these"") and the Indonesian city Grabahan (""grab a hand""). Many of these posed as infectious diseases online and were namedropped in conversation with the word Corona, as in, COVID-19. As the pandemic started to manifest in 2020, so did the use of ""sugma"" and ""bofa,"" which in turn led to its own kind of outbreak.

Sony Pictures is attempting to build a cinematic universe akin to Marvel Studios' using characters from the Spider-Man franchise. So far, this has gone, shall we say, not well, as The Amazing Spider-Man series intended to kick things off has generally been considered the weakest of the three Spider-Man film series, while the first ""extended universe"" ventures (the Venom films) have been met with far less enthusiasm than the films of Sony's Marvel competitors. This is all in the service of building up a group of Spider-Man villains known as the ""Sinister Six,"" who will presumably come together to fight Spider-Man in an eventual Avengers-like epic. Morbius, named for the vampiric doctor played by actor Jared Leto (who will eventually be part of that Sinister Six), is another entry in the Sony Spider-Man Universe. After going through a developmental hell that kept seeing its release date pushed back, it was finally released in April to little fanfare. It's since been brutally panned by critics and jokes about its supposed crappiness were coming out even before it was released. One particular early brand of jokes involved fans basically relating made up elements of the plot of Morbius in their reviews. These were all easily disproven (like ""Batman showed up and he and Morbius made out with President Biden,"" etc.), and on April 2nd, 2022, Twitter user @Rank10ygo came up with a scene where Morbius ""says"" his now-iconic line, ""It's Morbin Time."" Morbin' Time became wrapped in a trend of various memes about Morbius, such as Morbius Sweep, which centers around a fictional universe where Morbius is the most popular film in the world despite being generally considered a failure, not dissimilar to the memes surrounding a certain former Presidential candidate. The success of ""Morbin' Time"" as the key fake plot point from the film probably lies in its simplicity and catchiness. It's reminiscent of similar catchphrases, such as ""It's morphin' time!"" from Power Rangers and ""It's clobberin' time!"" said by Fantastic 4's The Thing. This made it amenable to various memes about the film, as seen on Reddit's /r/whenthe subreddit, where users would title myriad memes about the movie under the name ""Morbin' Time."" The phrase is also easy shorthand for the general joke around Morbius, which is that no one's seen it. Talking about Morbius saying ""It's Morbin' Time"" is a way to point out ""yeah, this sounds ridiculous, but it could very well be true. One thing's for sure, though: you're never going to know for sure.""

Who Is The 'Sky King' Richard Russell And How Did He Earn His Title?
","In 2018, a Horizon Air employee, Richard Russell, stole a plane with no prior flying experience, making international headlines. The incident resulted in Russell losing his life when he crashed on Ketron Island in Puget Sound, but people on sites like 4chan refused to let his story end there. They deemed Russell the Sky King inspiring an outpouring of memes in his memorial and a possible copycat this September. Here's the full story.  On August 10th, 2018, a service agent for Horizon Air named Richard ""Beebo"" Russell used his position to steal a Horizon Air Bombardier Dash 8 Q400 airliner from the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. Videos of the plane being followed by two F-15 fighter jets started going viral online as the story broke. The media also started sharing audio clips of ongoing conversations between Russell and an air traffic controller. In the audio clips, Russell calls himself ""broken"" and says he knows how to fly a little bit thanks to video games. His conversation and tone is very casual. He jokes around with the air traffic controller as he tries to explain to Russell how to land the plane, although as the conversation goes on that doesn't seem to be his intention, even saying, ""I wasn't really planning on landing it."" At one point, the controller suggests he might be able to get a job as a pilot after this and Russell replies, ""Nah, I'm a white guy."" At another point, he says he's going to try to ""do a barrel roll."" The incident came to a tragic end when Russell intentionally crashed the plane into Ketron Island in Puget Sound, killing him. As users on Twitter and 4chan shared and discussed the story and further learned about Russell through the conversations with air traffic control and subsequent articles about his life, they deemed him ""Sky King"" as a title of respect. Many saw Russell as a man suffering from depression and sympathized with him. Others saw his opinions on certain topics as based. They turned him into a hero with the name, and with it came a lot of memes.  Memes about Sky King spread across the internet after the incident. The majority of the memes are in celebration and memorial of Russell, while others are more trollish shitposts. Among the memes are images of Wojaks veering off into the sunset alongside quotes from Russell, a selfie of Russell sitting in the cockpit of the plane and video edits using audio clips from the conversation between Russell and the air traffic controller mixed with sad music and effects to emphasize the tragedy behind the event.  On September 3rd, CNN reported that an airport worker named Cory Wayne Patterson had stolen a twin-engine plane from Tupelo Aviation and was threatening to crash it into a Mississippi Walmart. Footage of Patterson flying the plane went viral on social media and people quickly started comparing it to the 2018 Sky King incident. Patterson did not end up flying the plane into Walmart, instead landing in a field where he was arrested.
