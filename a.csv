0,'I am quitting [...] effective immediately': Worker quits without notice after watching their coworkers being fired without notice. ,"Treat others how you would like to be treated: the golden rule. Regardless of your religious beliefs or affiliations, it stands to reason that this is a good principle to follow in order to build a moral foundation for one's actions. This ""golden rule"" or sometimes ""ethic of reciprocity"" appears universally throughout civilizations and cultures, dating back as far as 2000 BCE in Ancient Egypt. Despite its ubiquity in philosophy and religion, small business owners somehow seemed to have missed the memo, often expecting considerations from their workers that they themselves would never give to anyone. This brings us to a common problem regarding the 'trust fall' that is notice periods (and the act of giving notice in general) in the United States. With most of the US being employment at will, your employer could send you packing 20 seconds from now for whatever reason they desired, such as manifesting the failure of their business. So, when you go to give them your two-week notice, you might expect them to do the same in return, but they could take that notice and terminate your employment on the spot.With this in mind, when an employer has proven that, when push comes to shove, they themself won't follow a notice period, you shouldn't either when leaving that business. (However, if an employer has shown you nothing but respect, it would be wise to treat them with the same.)After watching two of their coworkers be let go without notice or warning, this worker knew that they were going to be saddled with the whole team's work and quickly made plans to make moves and get out of the toxic bakery where they worked. You might say, after all is bread and done, that the employer has found themselves in a shit show of their own baking. They'll knead to get on their hiring game to save themselves from disaster.

1,'I did it on purpose as revenge': Wife Goes On Vacation & Abandons Husband At Airport Because He's A Man Child & Forgot His Passport ,"Let's be honest, men have a tendency to put all the responsibility on the woman. Be it deciding what we'll eat for dinner or packing for a weekend trip away. Not like we have full-time jobs or anything. Must be nice to turn off your brain, not have to think about anything, and just be. But the funny thing is, not only do they put all this pressure on us, but they'll also blame us when things go wrong. 'You forgot to pack my favorite pair of shorts?', 'You forgot to buy my favorite snack'? The audacity! Welp, today we're bringing you a story of exactly just that: a neglectful husband that refuses to take responsibility and accountability for his own actions. Instead, he forces his wife to be the adult while he enjoys his carefree life. Welp, it looks like she finally taught him a well-deserved lesson. Have a read for yourself and comment below whose side you're on.

2,"'You Messed With the Wrong Neighbor' : HOA Penalize Man With Unfair Fines, He Plays Ultimate Long Game in Revenge, Leads to Foreclosure on Vice President's Home for Unpaid Fines Amounting to $10,000","Some housing communities have something called a homeowner association, and oftentimes, its purpose is to act as a little parasite, bugging people to no end with ridiculous notions such as 'Making sure your lawn is green enough' — in February, no less. This man was fined for exactly that, as well as for the fact that his trash cans were 1 foot away from where they were 'supposed to be', and he found it utterly ludicrous. He refused to accept this reality, so he came up with a plan. What ensued is a mix of malicious compliance and petty revenge. He took it upon himself to join the board with the sole purpose of revolutionalizing it to the point where people would not receive fines for things such as their flowers not fitting the neighborhood's aesthetic (Yeah… that is apparently a thing in some places. Just… wow). He succeeded far beyond his expectations and gives a detailed account of what happened below. Turns out the VP was quite the hypocrite, which makes this all the more infuriating. The moral of the story? Don't mess with people, because sometimes you're gonna mess with the wrong one, and make your life miserable. Scroll down to check out the crazier side of the world. If you're feeling a bit on the tired side and feel like you need a dose of dopamine to make it to and through the weekend, check out these hilarious work memes.

3,"Couple Decides To Film What Their Cat Does At Night, The Results Are Hissterical (Video)","Have you ever wondered what your cats do when you're asleep or when you're not home? We have, all the time. Every single time we leave the house for any extended time, we think about what our cats spend the whole day doing. Of course, cats go out of their way to cause chaos even when we are home, but we always assume that they really take the opportunity to do as much stuff that they know they're not allowed to do when we're not home. Still, we've never actually tried to film it. Well, some other people did. One person put up a camera and found out that their cat waits for them by the door the whole day while they're gone. Another person who put up a camera found out that their cat cuddles their dog every single day to comfort it when the humans are not home. And today, the couple who decided to film themselves to find out what their cat does when they're asleep… well, let's just say the result is somehow both the most wholesome yet the most hissterical thing you have seen.
