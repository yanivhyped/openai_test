As Twitter account @NocontextFBUK demonstrates, combining every boomer's favorite platform with that famous quintessential Britishness produces some bizarre but humorous results. For British readers, you may understand these jokes a bit better than we do. There's something so niche and specific about these no-context posts that the rest of us in Europe and overseas can't quite connect to (but trying to figure it out is funny nonetheless). British humor is a bizarre thing to behold, and while we can't always explain the jokes to you, we don't think they need much of a translation. Here, you can take a look at the British side of social media and remember why you hate those apps so much, and also be reminded why living in England is the better way. British humor is enlightening, so be ready for these strange yet alluring examples below.","

Well, us neither, but the following images we have collected from the subreddit /r/CrappyDesign prove that some people certainly have. Honestly, there's no other excuse for what we're seeing here, if drunkenness even counts as an excuse in the first place. Well, it doesn't, but at least it helps to rationalize what we're seeing. Examples of crappy design can remind you that some products and architectural setups were clearly mistakes, and they should have never been created. Now, I know we're not exactly qualified to make these ourselves, but these people still could have thought these through before they made them, right?

It's not difficult to be a decent human being. It's even easier to not be a total piece of sentient trash. Unfortunately, there are many, many people who couldn't care less about the rest of us, and during the past two years, they've been crawling out to wreak havoc on us more and more. We're not sure what it is about the bad news lately, but it seems to have given them an excuse to be even worse human beings than they were before, which is saying something, based on what we're seeing here. The following individuals really do exist on this planet and were collected from the subreddit /r/IAmATotalPieceOfSh*t, which is full of people who truly live up to the name.

Every aspect of our lives is made more difficult by these entitled people who don't bother to stop causing drama everywhere they go. Over the past few years, they've only gotten worse after finally being called out for their entitled behavior, and they grow stronger every day. Whether it comes in the form of a really confusing one-star review or an online petition against something totally normal, they've established a presence online that we can't help but laugh at. Watching Karens interact with others is like watching a car crash happen in slow motion, except the driver of that car is repeatedly trying to run down pedestrians completely unprovoked.
